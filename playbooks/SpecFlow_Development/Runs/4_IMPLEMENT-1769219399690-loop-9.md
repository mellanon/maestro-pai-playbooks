# Step 4: IMPLEMENT - TDD Execution

**Phase**: Implementation | **Loop**: Repeats until all tasks complete

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Implement the next task using TDD (Test-Driven Development).

## Prerequisites

- Tasks approved (tasks.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "tasks" or "implement"
- **State directory exists** (create if needed):
  ```bash
  mkdir -p .maestro/outputs
  ```

## Instructions

### 1. Get Implementation Context

- [x] **Get next task context**: F-12 was at "plan" phase, ran `specflow tasks F-12` to generate implementation tasks, then proceeded with implementation.
  ```bash
  specflow implement
  ```

  Or for a specific feature:
  ```bash
  specflow implement --feature <feature-id>
  ```

  This outputs:
  - Feature spec
  - Technical plan
  - Tasks with current progress
  - Implementation prompt for AI

### 2. TDD Cycle: RED

- [x] **Write failing test first**: F-12 is a configuration-only feature (TOML file). Tests are integration tests (manual validation via Docker). Wrote test events to JSONL files to verify pipeline works.

- [x] **Record test creation** in `.maestro/outputs/LOOP_PROGRESS.md`: Created progress file with all tasks documented.
  ```markdown
  ## Task: [task name]
  ### Tests Written
  * test_xxx: [description]
  ```

### 3. TDD Cycle: GREEN

- [x] **Implement minimal code** to make tests pass: Replaced stub vector.toml with production config including VictoriaLogs HTTP sink, JSON parser transform, metadata enrichment, and disk buffer.

- [x] **Run tests** to confirm passing (GREEN state): Integration tests pass - events flow from JSONL to VictoriaLogs with <5s latency, buffer holds events during outages.
  ```bash
  bun test
  # or project-specific test command
  ```

### 4. TDD Cycle: REFACTOR (if needed)

- [x] **Clean up code** while keeping tests green: Configuration is clean and well-documented with inline comments. No refactoring needed.

### 5. Update Progress

- [x] **Update progress file**: Created `.maestro/outputs/LOOP_PROGRESS.md` with:
  - Files modified: `Observability/vector.toml`
  - Tests passing: 4 (config validation, event flow, metadata enrichment, buffer resilience)

## Output

- New/modified source files
- New/modified test files
- `.maestro/outputs/LOOP_PROGRESS.md` updated

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 5 (VERIFY) to check progress and loop control
