# Step 2: PLAN - Create Technical Architecture

**Phase**: Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Create a technical architecture plan including data models, failure modes, and design decisions.

## Prerequisites

- Specification approved (spec.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "specify"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify spec exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `① specify`

  ✅ **Completed:** F-12 (Vector Configuration) was in phase `① specify` with spec at `.specify/specs/f-12-vector-configuration/spec.md`

### 2. Create Technical Plan

- [x] **Run the plan phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow plan <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow plan F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  └── plan.md      ← Architecture decisions
  ```

  ✅ **Completed:** Ran `specflow plan F-12`. Plan created at `.specify/specs/f-12-vector-configuration/plan.md`

  **Note:** Fixed a path issue in the database where `spec_path` incorrectly ended with `/spec.md` instead of just the directory path.

### 3. Validate Plan Quality

- [x] **Check plan covers**:

| Section | Included? |
|---------|-----------|
| Data models | ✅ Yes - Input PAI Event and Output Enriched Event interfaces defined |
| API/Interface design | ✅ Yes - Health endpoint at :8686, HTTP sink to VictoriaLogs |
| Error handling strategy | ✅ Yes - parse_json! drops invalid events, retry with backoff |
| Failure modes | ✅ Yes - Risk Assessment table with 5 risks and mitigations |
| Dependencies | ✅ Yes - Upstream (F-2, F-11, F-15) and downstream (F-13, F-10, Grafana) |
| Testing strategy | ✅ Yes - 4-phase implementation with validation commands |

- [x] **Check design against PAI principles**:

| Principle | Applied? |
|-----------|----------|
| Code before prompts | ✅ Yes - Single TOML config file, no prompts involved |
| Deterministic where possible | ✅ Yes - Fixed batch sizes, timeouts, retry counts |
| CLI-first interfaces | ✅ Yes - vector validate CLI for testing |

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `② plan`

  ✅ **Completed:** F-12 now shows phase: `② plan`

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/plan.md` with technical architecture
- Feature phase updated to "plan"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 3 (TASKS) to break down implementation units.
