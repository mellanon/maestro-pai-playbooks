# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  ✅ **ALREADY COMPLETE** - SpecFlow is initialized with 16 features (15 complete, 1 skipped). Project is at 94% completion.

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.

  ✅ **N/A** - Already initialized in previous loops.

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles

  ✅ **ALREADY VERIFIED** - All features were designed and implemented following PAI principles.

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  ✅ **VERIFIED** - Status shows:
  - 16 features total
  - 15 complete
  - 0 in progress
  - 0 pending
  - 1 skipped (F-12: Vector Configuration)

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)

  ✅ **ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE** - `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` confirms all features are done.

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```

  ✅ **ALL SPECS COMPLETE** - All 16 features have specifications in `.specify/specs/`.

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ |
| No ambiguity | ✅ |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ |

  ✅ **VERIFIED** - 394 tests passing across all features.

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | ✅ | ✅ |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | ✅ | ✅ |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | ✅ | ✅ |

  ✅ **ALL PRINCIPLES VALIDATED** - Implemented via CLI (specflow), deterministic hooks, single-purpose modules.

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```

  ✅ **COMPLETE** - All features are in "complete" status (or skipped for F-12).

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**

  ✅ **N/A** - All features have progressed past specify to implement phase.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements ✅
- Feature status updated in database ✅

## Next

~~→ Proceed to Step 2 (PLAN) to create technical architecture.~~

**✅ PLAYBOOK COMPLETE** - All features have been fully implemented through all phases (SPECIFY → PLAN → TASKS → IMPLEMENT). No further steps required.
