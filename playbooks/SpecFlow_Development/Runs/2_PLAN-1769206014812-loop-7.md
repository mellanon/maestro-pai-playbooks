# Step 2: PLAN - Create Technical Architecture

**Phase**: Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Create a technical architecture plan including data models, failure modes, and design decisions.

## Prerequisites

- Specification approved (spec.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "specify"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify spec exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `① specify`

  > ✅ **Loop 7 Note:** F-10 spec.md exists at `.specify/specs/f-10-cli-query-patterns/spec.md`

### 2. Create Technical Plan

- [x] **Run the plan phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow plan <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow plan F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  └── plan.md      ← Architecture decisions
  ```

  > ✅ **Loop 7 Note:** Plan phase completed in previous loop. plan.md exists at `.specify/specs/f-10-cli-query-patterns/plan.md` (314 lines)

### 3. Validate Plan Quality

- [x] **Check plan covers**:

| Section | Included? |
|---------|-----------|
| Data models | ✅ PAIEvent interface, event types table |
| API/Interface design | ✅ Architecture diagram, data flow, CLI scripts |
| Error handling strategy | ✅ Exit codes (0/1/2), require_jq(), graceful missing files |
| Failure modes | ✅ Risk Assessment table (5 risks with mitigations) |
| Dependencies | ✅ External tools (jq, bash, awk, date) + internal (F-1, F-2) |
| Testing strategy | ✅ Unit tests, fixtures, integration test plan |

- [x] **Check design against PAI principles**:

| Principle | Applied? |
|-----------|----------|
| Code before prompts | ✅ Pure shell scripts, no AI inference required |
| Deterministic where possible | ✅ Same input produces same output, no randomness |
| CLI-first interfaces | ✅ Entire feature is CLI-based (bash scripts with flags) |

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `② plan`

  > ✅ **Loop 7 Note:** F-10 is at phase `③ tasks` - already advanced beyond plan phase. All PLAN phase requirements verified complete.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/plan.md` with technical architecture
- Feature phase updated to "plan"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 3 (TASKS) to break down implementation units.
