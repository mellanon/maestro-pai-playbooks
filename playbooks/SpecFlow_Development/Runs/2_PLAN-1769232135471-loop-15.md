# Step 2: PLAN - Create Technical Architecture

**Phase**: Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Create a technical architecture plan including data models, failure modes, and design decisions.

## Prerequisites

- Specification approved (spec.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "specify"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify spec exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `① specify`

  > **STATUS (Loop 15):** All 16 features are already at phase `④ implement` with 100% completion. No features require planning - the project is fully implemented.

### 2. Create Technical Plan

- [x] **Run the plan phase**: N/A - All features already past plan phase

### 3. Validate Plan Quality

- [x] **Check plan covers**: N/A - All 16 features already complete with plan.md files

- [x] **Check design against PAI principles**: N/A - All features already implemented

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  > **RESULT:** 16 features | 16 complete | 100% progress. All features at phase `④ implement`.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/plan.md` with technical architecture
- Feature phase updated to "plan"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 3 (TASKS) to break down implementation units.
