# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ SpecFlow is initialized with 16 features. F-15 (Docker Compose Stack) is in progress at implement phase.

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.
  ✅ Already initialized - skipped.

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles
  ✅ F-15 spec already follows PAI principles (CLI-first, deterministic, UNIX philosophy).

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ 16 features total: 5 complete, 1 in progress (F-15), 10 pending. Progress: 31%

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  ✅ F-15 (Docker Compose Stack) is the current feature - already past SPECIFY phase, in IMPLEMENT.

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```
  ✅ Spec already exists at `.specify/specs/f-15-docker-compose-stack/spec.md` (11,306 bytes, comprehensive)

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ All acceptance criteria have testable conditions |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ FR-1 through FR-6 are clearly separated |
| No ambiguity | ✅ Ports, paths, commands explicitly specified |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ Upstream (Docker, images) and downstream (F-11, F-10) documented |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | ✅ Yes | ✅ Pinned image versions, explicit configs |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | ✅ Yes | ✅ manage.sh stack-* commands |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Each service has single responsibility |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="F-15")'
  ```
  ✅ F-15 is at phase "implement" (already past specify, plan, tasks phases)

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  ✅ Phase is actually "implement" - F-15 has already completed SPECIFY, PLAN, and TASKS phases.
  Implementation tasks T-1.1 and T-1.2 are complete; 9 tasks remain.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present spec to human for review before proceeding.

Show:
1. `spec.md` requirements
2. Feature description and rationale

**Only proceed to Step 2 after human approval.**
