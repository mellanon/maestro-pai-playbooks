# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

  **Note (Loop 4):** F-8 is already at phase `③ tasks` - plan exists and tasks were already generated. All implementation tasks (T-1.1 through T-4.1) are marked complete with 397 tests passing.

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

  **Note (Loop 4):** Tasks already created. F-8 implementation complete with:
  - `hooks/ToolResultInstrumentation.hook.ts` - PostToolUse hook
  - `hooks/ToolResultInstrumentation.hook.test.ts` - 33 tests, all passing
  - `settings.json` PostToolUse configuration with `.*` matcher

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`):

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | ✅ |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | ✅ |
| Dependencies are explicit | ✅ |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | ✅ |

- [x] **Check task granularity**:
  - [x] No task is too large (can be done in one session)
  - [x] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped)
  - [x] Each task has a verifiable outcome

  **Note (Loop 4):** F-8 tasks (T-1.1 through T-4.1) were properly granular with clear dependencies. All 11 tasks completed.

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `③ tasks`

  **Note (Loop 4):** Verified - F-8 now shows `● complete ④ implement` phase.

  **Completion Actions (Loop 4):**
  - Created `docs.md` with feature documentation
  - Created `verify.md` with verification results (33 unit tests, 397 project tests passing)
  - Ran `specflow complete F-8 --skip-doctorow`
  - Committed and pushed to `feature/signal-agent-2`

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Next

✅ **F-8 COMPLETE** - PostToolUse Hook Instrumentation is fully implemented.

Progress: 9/16 features (56%) complete.
