# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Phase Guard (MUST RUN FIRST)

Before doing any work, verify this step should run:

- [x] **Check if this step should execute**: SKIPPED - Phase guard: ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE
  ```bash
  # Read current feature ID
  FEATURE_ID=$(grep "Feature ID:" .maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md 2>/dev/null | awk -F: '{print $2}' | tr -d ' ')

  # Check if ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE
  if grep -q "ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE" .maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "PHASE_GUARD: SKIP - All features complete"
    exit 0
  fi

  # Check feature exists
  if [[ -z "$FEATURE_ID" ]]; then
    echo "PHASE_GUARD: SKIP - No current feature"
    exit 0
  fi

  # Step 1 only runs when phase is "none" or "specify"
  PHASE=$(specflow status "$FEATURE_ID" --json 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.phase' 2>/dev/null || echo "none")

  if [[ "$PHASE" != "none" && "$PHASE" != "specify" ]]; then
    echo "PHASE_GUARD: SKIP - Feature already past specify phase (current: $PHASE)"
    exit 0
  fi

  echo "PHASE_GUARD: PROCEED - $FEATURE_ID needs specification (phase: $PHASE)"
  ```

**If phase guard returns SKIP:** Mark ALL remaining tasks below as `[x] SKIPPED - Phase guard` and proceed to next document. This prevents stall detection from flagging unchecked boxes.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**: SKIPPED - Phase guard: ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec: SKIPPED - Phase guard: ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase: SKIPPED - Phase guard: ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**: SKIPPED - Phase guard: ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending): SKIPPED - Phase guard: ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature: SKIPPED - Phase guard: ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`: SKIPPED - Phase guard: ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | |
| Requirements are atomic | |
| No ambiguity | |
| Dependencies identified | |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**: SKIPPED - Phase guard: ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | | |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | | |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | | |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**: SKIPPED - Phase guard: ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**: SKIPPED - Phase guard: ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database
