# Step 6: COMPLETE - Validation and Finalization

**Phase**: Completion | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Validate all phases complete and mark the feature as done.

## Prerequisites

- All tests passing
- All tasks complete
- Step 5 loop control indicates completion

## Instructions

### 1. Final Validation

- [x] **Run comprehensive validation**: ✅ Validation passed (2026-01-24)
  ```bash
  specflow validate <feature-id>
  ```

  This checks:
  - ✓ spec.md exists and valid
  - ✓ plan.md exists and valid
  - ✓ tasks.md exists and all tasks complete
  - ✓ Tests referenced in tasks pass

### 2. Run Final Tests

- [x] **Execute full test suite**: ✅ 252 tests pass, 674 assertions (2026-01-24)
  ```bash
  bun test
  ```

- [x] **Run type checking** (if applicable): ✅ N/A - no root tsconfig.json (PAI is a collection of independent modules) (2026-01-24)
  ```bash
  bunx tsc --noEmit
  ```

### 3. Mark Feature Complete

- [x] **Complete the feature**: ✅ F-4 already marked complete in specflow (2026-01-24)
  ```bash
  specflow complete <feature-id>
  ```

  This:
  - Validates all SpecFlow phases
  - Runs the Doctorow Gate checklist
  - Updates feature status to "complete"

### 4. Review Doctorow Gate

The `specflow complete` command includes the **Doctorow Gate** - a checklist ensuring quality:

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Tests exist and pass | ✅ 252 tests pass |
| No unnecessary complexity added | ✅ Clean implementation following existing patterns |
| Code follows existing patterns | ✅ Uses same structure as locking.ts, logging.ts |
| Documentation updated if needed | ✅ CHANGELOG.md and docs.md updated |

### 5. Verify Completion

- [x] **Check final status**: ✅ F-4 shows `● complete` (2026-01-24)
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  Feature should show: `● complete`

### 6. Update Changelog

- [x] **Generate changelog entry from spec**: ✅ Already complete (2026-01-24)
  CHANGELOG.md contains comprehensive F-4 entry with:
  - Feature name: F-4 PII Scrubbing
  - Key capabilities: sanitizeEvent(), 9 default patterns, recursive processing, custom patterns
  - No breaking changes

- [x] **Update CHANGELOG.md**: ✅ Already complete (2026-01-24)

### 7. Sanitization Checklist

Before creating PR, verify no sensitive data is included.

- [x] **Check for secrets**: ✅ Pass (2026-01-24)
  All references are legitimate code (loading from env vars, config files, documentation) - no actual secrets.

- [x] **Check for personal paths**: ✅ Warning (2026-01-24)
  Found in `bin/ingest/lib/process.ts` - pre-existing issue, not part of F-4 changes.

- [x] **Check for hardcoded usernames**: ✅ Pass (2026-01-24)
  Only placeholder examples in docs (`your-username`, `your-email@example.com`) - acceptable.

- [x] **Verify config externalized**: ✅ Pass (2026-01-24)
  - [x] Secrets in `.env` files (not committed) - `.gitignore` excludes `.env`, `*.env`, `secrets/`
  - [x] No hardcoded credentials in source

### 8. Create File Inventory

- [x] **List files for PR** in `.maestro/outputs/FILE_INVENTORY.md`: ✅ Already complete (2026-01-24)
  FILE_INVENTORY.md exists with comprehensive content including all F-4 files and sanitization check results.

  ```markdown
  ## File Inventory

  ### Include (✅)
  | File | Reason |
  |------|--------|
  | `src/feature.ts` | Core implementation |
  | `test/feature.test.ts` | Test coverage |
  | `docs/feature.md` | Documentation |

  ### Exclude (❌)
  | Path | Reason |
  |------|--------|
  | `.env` | Contains secrets |
  | `test/fixtures/` | May contain PII |
  ```

### 9. Prepare for Next Feature

- [x] **Check if more features pending**: ✅ 11 features remain pending (2026-01-24)
  Next feature by ID order: F-5 (SessionStart Hook Instrumentation)
  All pending features need SpecFlow specification phases first.
  Created `.maestro/outputs/COMPLETION.md` with full completion report.

## Output

- Feature marked complete in database
- `CHANGELOG.md` updated with feature entry
- `.maestro/outputs/FILE_INVENTORY.md` with PR file list
- `.maestro/outputs/COMPLETION.md` summary

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present completion to human for final review.

Show:
1. `specflow status` output
2. Test results summary
3. CHANGELOG.md entry
4. FILE_INVENTORY.md (files for PR)
5. Sanitization check results

## Post-Completion

When ready to release:
```bash
# Stage changes
git add <specific files>

# Create commit
git commit -m "feat: [feature description]

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create --title "[title]" --body "..."
```

## Optional: Self-Review with PR_Review Playbook

After creating the PR, optionally run the **PR_Review** playbook for self-review.

## Feature Loop: Initialize Next Feature

After completing a feature, the playbook MUST check for and initialize the next feature.

### 10. Clear Current Feature State

- [x] **Archive completed feature context**: ✅ Archived CURRENT_FEATURE.md to .maestro/outputs/COMPLETED_FEATURES/FEATURE_F-4_2026-01-24.md (2026-01-24)

  Move current feature file to completed archive:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p .maestro/outputs/COMPLETED_FEATURES
  mv .maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md .maestro/outputs/COMPLETED_FEATURES/FEATURE_<id>_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
  ```

### 11. Check for Next Feature

- [x] **List remaining pending features (by ID order)**: ✅ 11 features remain pending. Next by ID: F-5 (SessionStart Hook Instrumentation) (2026-01-24)
  ```bash
  # Get next pending feature by ID order (not priority)
  NEXT_FEATURE=$(specflow status --json | jq -r '.features[] | select(.status == "pending") | .id' | sort -t'-' -k2 -n | head -1)
  echo "Next feature: $NEXT_FEATURE"
  ```

  **If features remain** (NEXT_FEATURE is not empty):
  - Record the feature ID (e.g., F-2, F-3, etc.)
  - Proceed to Task 12

  **If NO features remain** (NEXT_FEATURE is empty):
  - Write to `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`:
    ```markdown
    # Current Feature
    ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE

    All features have been implemented. Playbook complete.
    Date: <date>
    ```
  - Exit playbook (do NOT loop)

### 12. Initialize Next Feature

- [x] **Create new CURRENT_FEATURE.md for next feature**: ✅ Created CURRENT_FEATURE.md for F-5 SessionStart Hook Instrumentation (2026-01-24)

  Write to `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`:
  ```markdown
  # Current Feature

  - **Feature ID:** <next-feature-id>
  - **Feature Name:** <feature-name>
  - **Started:** <date>
  - **Phase:** none

  ## Notes

  Auto-selected as next feature in ID sequence after completing previous feature.
  ```

- [x] **Check if feature needs spec initialization**: ✅ F-5 is in phase `none` - requires SPECIFY phase. Will run in next playbook cycle (2026-01-24)
  ```bash
  specflow status <next-feature-id>
  ```

  If phase is `none`, run:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <next-feature-id>
  ```

### 13. Reset Playbook for Next Feature

- [x] **Clear loop artifacts from previous feature**: ✅ Removed LOOP_PROGRESS.md, LOOP_TEST_RESULTS.md, FILE_INVENTORY.md, COMPLETION.md (2026-01-24)

  Remove old loop files (keep COMPLETED_FEATURES archive):
  ```bash
  rm -f .maestro/outputs/LOOP_*_PROGRESS.md
  rm -f .maestro/outputs/LOOP_*_TEST_RESULTS.md
  rm -f .maestro/outputs/FILE_INVENTORY.md
  rm -f .maestro/outputs/COMPLETION.md
  ```

- [x] **Log feature transition**: ✅ Appended F-4→F-5 transition to PLAYBOOK_LOG.md (2026-01-24)

  Append to `.maestro/outputs/PLAYBOOK_LOG.md`:
  ```markdown
  ## Feature Transition - <date>

  - **Completed:** <previous-feature-id> - <previous-feature-name>
  - **Starting:** <next-feature-id> - <next-feature-name>
  - **Transition Time:** [timestamp]
  ```

## Loop Control

After completing Tasks 10-13, the playbook loops back to **Step 0 (SELECT_FEATURE)** to begin the next feature cycle.

**Loop continues until:**
- All features are complete (`specflow list --status pending` returns empty)
- Max loops reached (configurable in Maestro)
- Manual stop by user

---

## Playbook Complete (Final Exit)

The playbook only exits when `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` contains `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE`.

At that point:
1. All features have been implemented
2. PR_Review playbook can be run for final review
3. Session ends
