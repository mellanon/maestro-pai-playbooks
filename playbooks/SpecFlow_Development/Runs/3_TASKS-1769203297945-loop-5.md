# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

  **✅ Verified:** F-10 (CLI Query Patterns) was in phase `② plan` with spec.md and plan.md in `.specify/specs/f-10-cli-query-patterns/`

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

  **✅ Completed:** `~/bin/specflow tasks F-10` created 9 tasks across 3 phases:
  - Phase 1: Foundation (T-1.1, T-1.2)
  - Phase 2: Core Scripts (T-2.1 through T-2.5) - parallelizable
  - Phase 3: Polish & Validation (T-3.1, T-3.2)

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`):

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | ✅ All T-2.x tasks have [T] marker and explicit test paths |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | ✅ All tasks have acceptance criteria checklists |
| Dependencies are explicit | ✅ Each task lists dependencies (e.g., "Dependencies: T-1.1") |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | ✅ Clear dependency graph: T-1.1 → T-2.x (parallel) → T-3.1 → T-3.2 |

- [x] **Check task granularity**:
  - [x] No task is too large (can be done in one session) — Each script is ~45-75 lines
  - [x] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped) — No single-line tasks
  - [x] Each task has a verifiable outcome — All have specific output formats and acceptance criteria

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `③ tasks`

  **✅ Verified:** `specflow status` shows F-10 at phase `③ tasks`

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 4 (IMPLEMENT) to begin TDD implementation.
