# Step 2: PLAN - Create Technical Architecture

**Phase**: Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Create a technical architecture plan including data models, failure modes, and design decisions.

## Prerequisites

- Specification approved (spec.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "specify"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify spec exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `① specify`

  > **LOOP 19 NOTE:** ALL 16 FEATURES ARE COMPLETE (100%). This step was completed in earlier loops. Current status shows all features at phase `④ implement` with status `● complete`.

### 2. Create Technical Plan

- [x] **Run the plan phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow plan <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow plan F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  └── plan.md      ← Architecture decisions
  ```

  > **LOOP 19 NOTE:** All plan.md files were created in earlier loops for all 16 features.

### 3. Validate Plan Quality

- [x] **Check plan covers**:

| Section | Included? |
|---------|-----------|
| Data models | ✓ |
| API/Interface design | ✓ |
| Error handling strategy | ✓ |
| Failure modes | ✓ |
| Dependencies | ✓ |
| Testing strategy | ✓ |

- [x] **Check design against PAI principles**:

| Principle | Applied? |
|-----------|----------|
| Code before prompts | ✓ |
| Deterministic where possible | ✓ |
| CLI-first interfaces | ✓ |

> **LOOP 19 NOTE:** All 16 features were validated and implemented successfully.

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `② plan`

  > **LOOP 19 NOTE:** All 16 features have progressed beyond plan phase and are now 100% complete at phase `④ implement`.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/plan.md` with technical architecture
- Feature phase updated to "plan"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 3 (TASKS) to break down implementation units.

## Loop 19 Final Status

**ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE** - 16 features | 16 complete | 0 in progress | 0 pending

The SpecFlow Development playbook has been fully executed. All features have been:
1. Specified (spec.md)
2. Planned (plan.md)
3. Task-broken (tasks.md)
4. Implemented and verified

No remaining work for this playbook.
