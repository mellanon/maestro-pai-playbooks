# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  **Note:** SpecFlow already initialized with 16 features (7 complete, 9 pending).

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.
  **Note:** Already initialized, skipped.

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles
  **Note:** PAI-PRINCIPLES.md not present in this branch. Principles referenced from existing specs (F-5, F-6) and applied to F-7.

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  **Note:** Viewed. F-7 (PreToolUse Hook Instrumentation) identified as next feature.

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  **Note:** CURRENT_FEATURE.md shows F-7 as current feature (auto-selected after F-6 completion).

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```
  **Note:** Created `.specify/specs/f-7-pretooluse-hook-instrumentation/spec.md` with detailed specification including:
  - 4 user scenarios (tool tracking, skill invocation, security correlation, graceful degradation)
  - 8 functional requirements
  - 3 non-functional requirements
  - Complete code implementation examples
  - Expected event outputs
  - Test strategy

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✓ Each success criterion maps to verifiable test |
| Requirements are atomic | ✓ Single hook, clear event types, defined boundaries |
| No ambiguity | ✓ Code examples show exact implementation |
| Dependencies identified | ✓ F-1, F-2 clearly stated as upstream |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | ✓ | ✓ Event emission is deterministic |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | N/A | N/A (hook, not CLI) |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | ✓ | ✓ Single purpose: emit tool events |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="F-7")'
  ```
  **Result:** Feature F-7 now in phase "specify"

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  **Confirmed:** `"phase": "specify"`

## Output

- `.specify/specs/f-7-pretooluse-hook-instrumentation/spec.md` with detailed requirements ✓
- Feature status updated in database ✓
