# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  *(Completed: SpecFlow is initialized with 16 features, 7 complete, 9 pending)*

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.
  *(N/A: Already initialized)*

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles
  *(Note: File does not exist in this project - skipped)*

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  *(Completed: 16 features total, F-7 identified as next)*

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  *(Completed: F-7 PreToolUse Hook Instrumentation)*

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```
  *(Completed: Created .specify/specs/f-7-pretooluse-hook-instrumentation/spec.md with 6 functional requirements)*

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | YES - All FRs have validation criteria |
| Requirements are atomic | YES - Each FR single concern |
| No ambiguity | YES - Code examples provided |
| Dependencies identified | YES - F-1, F-2, F-4 listed |

*(Note: docs/TDD-EVALS.md does not exist - validated against criteria in task file)*

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | YES | YES - Fire-and-forget pattern |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | N/A | N/A - Hook, not CLI |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | YES | YES - Single hook for tool.use events |

*(Note: docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md does not exist - validated against principles in task file)*

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```
  *(Completed: F-7 phase is "specify")*

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  *(Confirmed: F-7 is now in specify phase)*

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database
