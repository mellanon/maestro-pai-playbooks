# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**: ✅ Verified - F-4 is in phase "② plan" with plan.md present (20,797 bytes)
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**: ✅ Created tasks.md with 15 implementation tasks
  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`):

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | ✅ All 15 tasks have [T] marker and specify test file |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | ✅ Each task has explicit acceptance checkboxes |
| Dependencies are explicit | ✅ All dependencies listed (e.g., T-2.1 depends on T-1.2) |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | ✅ Execution order section defines 5 phases with dependency flow |

- [x] **Check task granularity**:
  - [x] No task is too large (can be done in one session) ✅ Each task is a single function or test category
  - [x] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped) ✅ Testing tasks grouped by category (5.1-5.6)
  - [x] Each task has a verifiable outcome ✅ All tasks have acceptance criteria checkboxes

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**: ✅ F-4 now shows phase: `③ tasks`
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `③ tasks`

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present task breakdown to human for review before implementation.

Show:
1. `tasks.md` breakdown
2. Task dependencies
3. Estimated scope

**Only proceed to Step 4 after human approval.**
