# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✓ SpecFlow is initialized with 15 features, 5 complete, 10 pending. F-6 (SessionStop Hook Instrumentation) identified as current feature.

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec: (N/A - already initialized)
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles
  ✓ Constitutional gate documents not found in this worktree. Will apply general PAI principles: deterministic code, CLI interfaces, UNIX philosophy (single purpose).

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✓ Feature queue reviewed: 15 features total, 5 complete, 10 pending. F-6 is current target.

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  ✓ F-6: SessionStop Hook Instrumentation (Priority 4, Status: pending, Phase: none)

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```
  ✓ Created `.specify/specs/f-6-sessionstop-hook-instrumentation/spec.md` with full specification
  ✓ Updated F-6 phase: none → specify

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✓ Each success criterion maps to verifiable test |
| Requirements are atomic | ✓ Single event type, single hook, clear boundaries |
| No ambiguity | ✓ Code examples show exact implementation |
| Dependencies identified | ✓ F-1, F-2, F-5 clearly stated as upstream |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | ✓ | ✓ Event emission is deterministic (same input → same event) |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | ✓ | ✓ Events queryable via grep/jq |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | ✓ | ✓ Single purpose: emit session.end event |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```
  ✓ F-6 status confirmed: phase="specify", status="pending"

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  ✓ Phase confirmed as "specify"

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present spec to human for review before proceeding.

Show:
1. `spec.md` requirements
2. Feature description and rationale

**Only proceed to Step 2 after human approval.**
