# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  > **Note (Loop 12):** SpecFlow CLI not available, but project is initialized via manual `.maestro/` and `.specify/` directories. 14 features completed (F-2 through F-15, excluding F-1). Current feature: F-016.

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.
  > **Note (Loop 12):** Already initialized. Skipped.

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles
  > **Note (Loop 12):** Read `skills/CORE/SYSTEM/PAISYSTEMARCHITECTURE.md` which contains the Founding Principles. Key principles applied: Single Responsibility, CLI interfaces, Deterministic code, Code before prompts.

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  > **Note (Loop 12):** Checked `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` - F-016 "Skill Invocation Enforcement" at phase "none".

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  > **Note (Loop 12):** F-016 identified. Description: PreToolUse hook on Skill tool that (1) logs skill.invoked event with certainty, (2) injects USER extension loading instructions (USER/{skill}/EXTEND.yaml).

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```
  > **Note (Loop 12):** Created `.specify/specs/f-016-skill-invocation-enforcement/spec.md` manually. Spec includes:
  > - Overview: PreToolUse hook for Skill tool customization enforcement
  > - 4 User Scenarios: With/without customizations, malformed YAML, disabled customizations
  > - 5 Functional Requirements: Hook creation, settings.json config, schema validation, context injection format, error handling
  > - Non-functional requirements: Performance (<20ms), reliability (fail-open), security (path traversal prevention)
  > - Dependencies: F-7 (ToolUseInstrumentation), Claude Code PreToolUse lifecycle
  > - Success criteria: 11 testable items

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ Each FR has validation criteria |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ Each FR is a single concern |
| No ambiguity | ✅ Code examples provided |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ F-7 dependency documented |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | Yes | ✅ File existence check is deterministic |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | N/A | Hook, not CLI |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | Yes | ✅ Separate from observability hook |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```
  > **Note (Loop 12):** Spec created at `.specify/specs/f-016-skill-invocation-enforcement/spec.md`

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  > **Note (Loop 12):** Phase is now "specify". Ready for PLAN phase.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 2 (PLAN) to create technical architecture.
