# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ **VERIFIED (Loop 8):** SpecFlow is initialized with 16 features. F-15 (Docker Compose Stack) is in progress at the `implement` phase with 31% overall progress.

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.

  ✅ **SKIPPED (Loop 8):** Already initialized. Project has 16 features with 5 complete.

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles

  ✅ **VERIFIED (Loop 8):** Constitutional gates read from `~/.claude/skills/CORE/SYSTEM/PAISYSTEMARCHITECTURE.md`. Key principles applicable to F-15:
  - CLI-first architecture (manage.sh integration)
  - UNIX philosophy (docker-compose for single-purpose container orchestration)
  - Deterministic code preferred (pinned image versions)
  - Code before prompts (infrastructure as code)

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ **VERIFIED (Loop 8):** 16 features total, 5 complete, 1 in progress (F-15), 10 pending.

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  ✅ **VERIFIED (Loop 8):** F-15 Docker Compose Stack is current feature per `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```

  ✅ **VERIFIED (Loop 8):** Specification already complete. Full spec exists at `.specify/specs/f-15-docker-compose-stack/spec.md` (393 lines). Includes:
  - 4 user scenarios with acceptance criteria
  - 6 functional requirements (FR-1 to FR-6)
  - Non-functional requirements (performance, reliability, security)
  - Key entities, dependencies, success criteria, assumptions, out of scope

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ All acceptance criteria have concrete verification steps (e.g., "localhost:8428 accessible") |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ Each FR addresses single concern (e.g., FR-1 docker-compose, FR-2 datasources) |
| No ambiguity | ✅ Ports, retention periods, credentials all explicitly specified |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ Upstream (Docker, images) and downstream (F-11 collector) documented |

  ✅ **VALIDATED (Loop 8):** Spec meets all quality criteria.

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | ✅ Yes | ✅ Pinned image versions (v1.115.0, v1.8.0, 11.4.0) |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | ✅ Yes | ✅ manage.sh stack-* commands for all operations |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Each container does one thing (metrics/logs/traces/viz) |

  ✅ **VALIDATED (Loop 8):** Design follows PAI founding principles.

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```
  ✅ **VERIFIED (Loop 8):** F-15 status checked. Feature is in `implement` phase (past specify).

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  ⚠️ **NOTE (Loop 8):** Phase is `implement`, not `specify`. This indicates F-15 has already passed through:
  - ✅ specify (spec.md exists)
  - ✅ plan (plan.md exists)
  - ✅ tasks (tasks.md exists)
  - 🔄 implement (in progress)

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present spec to human for review before proceeding.

Show:
1. `spec.md` requirements
2. Feature description and rationale

**Only proceed to Step 2 after human approval.**
