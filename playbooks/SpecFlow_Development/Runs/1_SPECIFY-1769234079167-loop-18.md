# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  ✅ **VERIFIED**: SpecFlow is initialized and shows **ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE** (16 features, 100% progress)

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.

  ⏭️ **SKIPPED**: Already initialized with all 16 features complete

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles

  ✅ **N/A**: All features already complete - constitutional gates were applied during prior specify phases

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  ✅ **Result**: 16 features | 16 complete | 0 in progress | 0 pending | Progress: 100%

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)

  ✅ **Result**: `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` shows `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE` - no features remaining to specify

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```

  ⏭️ **SKIPPED**: No features pending specification - all 16 features already specified and implemented

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | |
| Requirements are atomic | |
| No ambiguity | |
| Dependencies identified | |

  ⏭️ **N/A**: All specs previously validated during implementation phases

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | | |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | | |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | | |

  ⏭️ **N/A**: All designs previously validated - all 16 features complete

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```

  ✅ **Result**: All 16 features at "implement" phase (complete)

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**

  ✅ **PLAYBOOK COMPLETE**: All features have progressed beyond "specify" to "implement" (complete)

## ⚠️ PLAYBOOK STATUS

**ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE** - Nothing remains to specify. The playbook has successfully completed all 16 features:
- 15 features fully implemented
- 1 feature skipped (F-12 Vector Configuration)
- 394 tests passing

**Next Steps** (as per `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`):
1. Create PR for feature branch
2. Run PR_Review playbook for self-review (optional)
3. Merge to main

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 2 (PLAN) to create technical architecture.
