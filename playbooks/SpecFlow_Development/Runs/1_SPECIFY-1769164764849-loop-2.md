# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ SpecFlow is initialized with 15 features (2 complete, 13 pending)

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec: *(N/A - already initialized)*
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - *(File not present in project - PAI principles from CORE skill apply)*

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ 15 features: F-1 & F-2 complete, F-3 through F-15 pending

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  ✅ **F-3: Concurrent Write Handling** - Auto-selected as next feature after F-2 completion

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```

  ✅ Created `.specify/specs/f-3-concurrent-write-handling/spec.md` with:
  - 4 user scenarios (concurrent writes, fallback, timeout, stale lock recovery)
  - 6 functional requirements (FR-1 through FR-6)
  - 4 non-functional requirements (performance, reliability, observability, compatibility)
  - 4 design decisions (rename-based locking, per-agent fallback, per-date locks, timeout with fallback)
  - Test strategy (unit, integration, stress tests)

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ Each FR has validation criteria and test strategy |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ Each FR is self-contained (FR-1 lock mechanism, FR-2 fallback, etc.) |
| No ambiguity | ✅ Specific code examples, timeouts in ms, clear behavior tables |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ Depends on F-2, downstream consumers documented |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | ✅ Yes | ✅ Synchronous file ops, explicit timeouts, no non-deterministic behavior |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | ⚪ N/A | ⚪ Internal library, not CLI |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | ✅ Yes | ✅ locking.ts handles only locking, logging.ts handles only logging |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```
  ✅ F-3 status: pending, phase: specify, specPath set correctly

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  ✅ Phase confirmed as "specify"

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present spec to human for review before proceeding.

Show:
1. `spec.md` requirements
2. Feature description and rationale

**Only proceed to Step 2 after human approval.**
