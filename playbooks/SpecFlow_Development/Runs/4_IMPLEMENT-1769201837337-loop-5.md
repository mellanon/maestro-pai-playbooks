# Step 4: IMPLEMENT - TDD Execution

**Phase**: Implementation | **Loop**: Repeats until all tasks complete

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Implement the next task using TDD (Test-Driven Development).

## Prerequisites

- Tasks approved (tasks.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "tasks" or "implement"
- **State directory exists** (create if needed):
  ```bash
  mkdir -p .maestro/outputs
  ```

## Instructions

### 1. Get Implementation Context

- [x] **Get next task context**:
  ```bash
  specflow implement
  ```

  Or for a specific feature:
  ```bash
  specflow implement --feature <feature-id>
  ```

  This outputs:
  - Feature spec
  - Technical plan
  - Tasks with current progress
  - Implementation prompt for AI

  **Notes:** F-9 was in PLAN phase, completed TASKS phase via `specflow tasks F-9`. All 6 tasks created.

### 2. TDD Cycle: RED

- [x] **Write failing test first**:
  - Create test file if doesn't exist
  - Write test for the current task's acceptance criteria
  - Run tests to confirm failure (RED state)

  **Notes:** Created `hook-timer.test.ts` with 20 comprehensive tests covering start/complete flow, phase timing, and edge cases. Tests failed initially with "Cannot find module" as expected.

- [x] **Record test creation** in `.maestro/outputs/LOOP_PROGRESS.md`:
  ```markdown
  ## Task: [task name]
  ### Tests Written
  * test_xxx: [description]
  ```

### 3. TDD Cycle: GREEN

- [x] **Implement minimal code** to make tests pass:
  - Focus only on current task
  - Don't over-engineer
  - Follow the plan.md architecture

  **Notes:** Created `hook-timer.ts` with HookTimer class implementing start(), phase(), complete(), and elapsed() methods per spec.

- [x] **Run tests** to confirm passing (GREEN state):
  ```bash
  bun test
  # or project-specific test command
  ```

  **Notes:** All 20 tests passing: `bun test Observability/lib/events/hook-timer.test.ts`

### 4. TDD Cycle: REFACTOR (if needed)

- [x] **Clean up code** while keeping tests green:
  - Remove duplication
  - Improve naming
  - Keep it simple

  **Notes:** Code follows spec pattern closely, no refactoring needed. Added HookTimer export to index.ts.

### 5. Update Progress

- [x] **Update progress file**:
  ```markdown
  ### Implementation
  - Files created: [list]
  - Files modified: [list]
  - Tests passing: [count]
  ```

  **Notes:** Updated LOOP_PROGRESS.md with all implementation details.

## Output

- New/modified source files
- New/modified test files
- `.maestro/outputs/LOOP_PROGRESS.md` updated
