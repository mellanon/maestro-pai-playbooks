# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Phase Guard (MUST RUN FIRST)

Before doing any work, verify this step should run:

- [x] **Check if this step should execute**: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

**If phase guard returns SKIP:** Mark ALL remaining tasks below as `[x] SKIPPED - Phase guard` and proceed to next document. This prevents stall detection from flagging unchecked boxes.

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`): SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

- [x] **Check task granularity**: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 4 (IMPLEMENT) to begin TDD implementation.
