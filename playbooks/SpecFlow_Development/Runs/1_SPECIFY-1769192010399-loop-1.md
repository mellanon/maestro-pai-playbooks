# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ **Completed (2026-01-24):** SpecFlow is initialized with 16 features (6 complete, 10 pending). Progress: 38%. F-6 (SessionStop Hook Instrumentation) is in "specify" phase and ready for validation.

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ✅ **N/A (2026-01-24):** SpecFlow is already initialized (verified via `specflow status`). Skip this conditional step.

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles
  ✅ **Completed (2026-01-24):** Constitutional gates are embedded in the F-6 spec.md itself (lines 455-495). The spec includes PAI-PRINCIPLES validation table covering all 16 principles.

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ **Completed (2026-01-24):** 16 features total, 6 complete (38%). F-6 is in "specify" phase ready for validation.

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  ✅ **Completed (2026-01-24):** F-6 (SessionStop Hook Instrumentation) identified as next feature - currently in "specify" phase.

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```
  ✅ **Completed (2026-01-24):** Spec exists at `.specify/specs/f-6-sessionstop-hook-instrumentation/spec.md` (17,406 bytes). Comprehensive 505-line specification with:
  - 4 user scenarios with acceptance criteria
  - 7 functional requirements (FR-1 through FR-7)
  - 3 non-functional requirements
  - 4 design decisions with rationale
  - Full test strategy (unit, integration, verification)
  - Constitutional gate validation embedded

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ Each success criterion maps to verifiable test |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ Single event, single hook, clear boundaries |
| No ambiguity | ✅ Code examples show exact implementation |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ F-1, F-2, F-5 clearly stated as upstream |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | ✅ | ✅ Pure TypeScript, same input → same event |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | N/A | Event library, not CLI |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | ✅ | ✅ Single purpose: emit session.end event |

✅ **Completed (2026-01-24):** Spec validated against all quality criteria. Constitutional validation included in spec lines 455-495.

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```
  ✅ **Completed (2026-01-24):** F-6 status verified:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "F-6",
    "name": "SessionStop Hook Instrumentation",
    "status": "pending",
    "phase": "specify",
    "priority": 4,
    "specPath": ".specify/specs/f-6-sessionstop-hook-instrumentation"
  }
  ```

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  ✅ **Completed (2026-01-24):** Phase confirmed as "specify". Spec is complete and validated. Ready to proceed to Step 2 (PLAN).

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 2 (PLAN) to create technical architecture.
