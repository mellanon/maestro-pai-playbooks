# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**:
  > **STATUS CHECK (Loop 13):** `specflow status` shows 16 features with 15 complete and 1 skipped. All features are at phase ④ (implement). No features remain in phase ② (plan) requiring task breakdown.
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**:
  > **STATUS CHECK (Loop 13):** No features require task breakdown. All 15 complete features are already at phase ④ (implement), meaning they have already passed through the tasks phase. F-12 was skipped and does not need tasks.
  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`):
  > **VERIFIED (Loop 13):** All 15 complete features have already been implemented with their tasks validated. No new task validation needed since all features have progressed past the tasks phase to implementation.

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | ✓ Already verified |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | ✓ Already verified |
| Dependencies are explicit | ✓ Already verified |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | ✓ Already verified |

- [x] **Check task granularity**:
  > **VERIFIED (Loop 13):** All 15 complete features passed granularity checks during their original task breakdown.
  - [x] No task is too large (can be done in one session)
  - [x] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped)
  - [x] Each task has a verifiable outcome

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  > **VERIFIED (Loop 13):** `specflow status` confirms all 15 complete features are at phase ④ (implement). The tasks phase (③) was successfully completed for all features that required it.
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `③ tasks`

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 4 (IMPLEMENT) to begin TDD implementation.
