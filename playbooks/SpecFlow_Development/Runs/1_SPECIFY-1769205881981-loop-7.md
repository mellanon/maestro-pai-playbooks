# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ SpecFlow is initialized with 16 features (10 complete, 1 in progress, 5 pending)

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.
  ✅ SKIPPED - Already initialized

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles
  ✅ Note: PAI-PRINCIPLES.md not present in this project - using SpecFlow's built-in validation

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ Feature queue shows F-10 "CLI Query Patterns" in progress at `tasks` phase

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  ✅ Current feature is F-10 "CLI Query Patterns" - already past SPECIFY phase (in `tasks` phase)

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```
  ✅ F-10 spec already exists at `.specify/specs/f-10-cli-query-patterns/spec.md` with 586 lines of detailed requirements

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ Each script has validation section with specific test cases |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ Each FR (FR-1 through FR-6) covers one script with clear boundaries |
| No ambiguity | ✅ Includes complete code examples with exact behavior specified |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ Upstream (F-1, F-2, jq) and downstream consumers documented |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | ✅ Yes | ✅ Shell scripts with jq produce deterministic output from same input |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | ✅ Yes | ✅ All scripts are CLI tools with --help and argument parsing |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Each script does one thing: errors-today, session-duration, api-costs, slow-hooks, skill-usage |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="F-10")'
  ```
  ✅ F-10 status: in_progress, phase: tasks, specPath confirmed at `.specify/specs/f-10-cli-query-patterns`

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  ✅ F-10 is actually past "specify" phase - currently in "tasks" phase, meaning SPECIFY and PLAN are already complete. All spec files exist: spec.md (586 lines), plan.md, tasks.md

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database
