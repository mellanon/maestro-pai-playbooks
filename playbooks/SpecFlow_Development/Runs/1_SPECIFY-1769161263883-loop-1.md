# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  **Signal-2 Note (2026-01-23):** SpecFirst/SpecFlow is initialized:
  - `.specfirst/state.json` exists with project "2.3-docx" in RELEASE phase
  - `.specflow/features.db` contains 15 features (F-1 through F-15)
  - F-1 (Event Schema and Types) is complete
  - F-2 (Event Logging Library) is the next pending feature
  - The `specflow` command doesn't exist; use `specfirst` CLI or query the SQLite database directly

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.

  **Signal-2 Note (2026-01-23):** SKIPPED - SpecFlow is already initialized:
  - `.specfirst/state.json` exists (project "2.3-docx", phase RELEASE)
  - `.specflow/features.db` contains 15 features (F-1 through F-15)
  - No initialization needed

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles

  **Signal-2 Note (2026-01-23):** The file `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` does not exist. The PAI Founding Principles are documented in `skills/CORE/SYSTEM/PAISYSTEMARCHITECTURE.md`. Read and extracted the 16 constitutional principles that govern all feature design:

  **Applicable Constitutional Gates for F-2 (Event Logging Library):**

  | Principle | Relevance to F-2 |
  |-----------|------------------|
  | **#5: As Deterministic as Possible** | Same input → same output. Event logging must be predictable and repeatable. |
  | **#6: Code Before Prompts** | TypeScript library, no AI prompting needed for logging. |
  | **#7: Spec / Test / Evals First** | Spec exists (from F-1). Tests must be written before implementation. |
  | **#8: UNIX Philosophy** | Single purpose - emit events to JSONL. Composable via standard I/O. |
  | **#9: ENG / SRE Principles** | Version control, monitoring, graceful degradation, fail-safe design. |
  | **#10: CLI as Interface** | Library should support CLI invocation for testing. |
  | **#11: Goal → Code → CLI → Prompts → Agents** | This is pure code layer - no prompts/agents needed. |

  **Key Constraints Identified:**
  - Must serialize to JSON without data loss (no Date objects, Maps, Sets)
  - Fire-and-forget design - logging must never block execution
  - Must handle concurrent writes safely (multiple agents writing simultaneously)
  - Must support the PAIEvent schema defined in F-1

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  **Signal-2 Note (2026-01-23):** Queried `.specflow/features.db` directly (no `specflow` CLI):

  | ID | Feature | Status | Phase | Priority |
  |----|---------|--------|-------|----------|
  | F-1 | Event Schema and Types | complete | implement | - |
  | F-2 | Event Logging Library | pending | none | 2 |
  | F-3 | Concurrent Write Handling | pending | none | - |
  | F-4 | PII Scrubbing | pending | none | - |
  | F-5 | SessionStart Hook Instrumentation | pending | none | - |
  | F-6 | SessionStop Hook Instrumentation | pending | none | - |
  | F-7 | PreToolUse Hook Instrumentation | pending | none | - |
  | F-8 | PostToolUse Hook Instrumentation | pending | none | - |
  | F-9 | Hook Timing Instrumentation | pending | none | - |
  | F-10 | CLI Query Patterns | pending | none | 3 |
  | F-11 | Collector Script (launchd + curl) | pending | none | 3 |
  | F-12 | Collector launchd Plist | pending | none | - |
  | F-13 | Watchdog Script | pending | none | - |
  | F-14 | Log Rotation Script | pending | none | 3 |
  | F-15 | Docker Compose Stack | pending | none | 1 |

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)

  **Signal-2 Note (2026-01-23):**
  - `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` does not exist
  - By dependency analysis: **F-2 (Event Logging Library)** is the correct next feature
  - Rationale: F-2 is the foundation that F-5 through F-9 (hook instrumentation) depend on
  - F-15 has priority 1 but is infrastructure that needs events to collect - should come last
  - Logical order: F-2 → F-3 → F-4 → F-5-F-9 → F-10-F-14 → F-15

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```

  **Signal-2 Note (2026-01-23):** Created specification manually (no `specflow` CLI):
  - Created `.specify/specs/f-2-event-logging-library/spec.md`
  - Spec follows F-1 format: YAML front matter, User Scenarios, FR-*, NFR, Success Criteria
  - Key design decisions:
    - Synchronous file I/O (not async) for guaranteed write completion
    - Fire-and-forget semantics (never throws)
    - Date-partitioned files: `$PAI_HOME/MEMORY/Events/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`
    - Config cached at module load (not per-call)

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ Each FR-* has explicit "Validation:" section with test criteria |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ FR-1 through FR-8 are single-responsibility |
| No ambiguity | ✅ Concrete code examples, exact file paths, measurable targets |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ Upstream (F-1, Node.js fs) and Downstream (F-5 through F-9) documented |

  **Signal-2 Note (2026-01-23):** `docs/TDD-EVALS.md` does not exist. Validated against criteria in this document. All requirements are testable with explicit validation criteria.

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| #5: Deterministic code preferred | ✅ Yes | ✅ Same input → same output. Synchronous I/O guarantees write order. |
| #6: Code Before Prompts | ✅ Yes | ✅ Pure TypeScript library, no AI prompting needed. |
| #7: Spec / Test / Evals First | ✅ Yes | ✅ Spec written first. Each FR has validation criteria. |
| #8: UNIX Philosophy | ✅ Yes | ✅ Single purpose: emit events to JSONL. Composable output. |
| #9: ENG / SRE Principles | ✅ Yes | ✅ Graceful degradation (never throws), fail-safe design. |
| #10: CLI interfaces where applicable | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Library exposes function; CLI wrapper can be added later. |
| #11: Goal → Code → CLI → Prompts → Agents | ✅ Yes | ✅ This is pure code layer - no prompts/agents needed. |

  **Signal-2 Note (2026-01-23):** `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` does not exist. Validated against `skills/CORE/SYSTEM/PAISYSTEMARCHITECTURE.md` (the canonical source). Design aligns with all applicable principles.

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```

  **Signal-2 Note (2026-01-23):** Updated database directly:
  ```sql
  UPDATE features SET phase='specify' WHERE id='F-2';
  ```

  Current F-2 status:
  | ID | Name | Status | Phase |
  |----|------|--------|-------|
  | F-2 | Event Logging Library | pending | specify |

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**

  **Signal-2 Note (2026-01-23):** ✅ Phase confirmed as "specify". Specification complete at:
  `.specify/specs/f-2-event-logging-library/spec.md`

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present spec to human for review before proceeding.

Show:
1. `spec.md` requirements
2. Feature description and rationale

**Only proceed to Step 2 after human approval.**
