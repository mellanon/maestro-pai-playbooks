# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  **Signal-2 Note (2026-01-23):** SpecFirst/SpecFlow is initialized:
  - `.specfirst/state.json` exists with project "2.3-docx" in RELEASE phase
  - `.specflow/features.db` contains 15 features (F-1 through F-15)
  - F-1 (Event Schema and Types) is complete
  - F-2 (Event Logging Library) is the next pending feature
  - The `specflow` command doesn't exist; use `specfirst` CLI or query the SQLite database directly

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.

  **Signal-2 Note (2026-01-23):** SKIPPED - SpecFlow is already initialized:
  - `.specfirst/state.json` exists (project "2.3-docx", phase RELEASE)
  - `.specflow/features.db` contains 15 features (F-1 through F-15)
  - No initialization needed

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles

  **Signal-2 Note (2026-01-23):** The file `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` does not exist. The PAI Founding Principles are documented in `skills/CORE/SYSTEM/PAISYSTEMARCHITECTURE.md`. Read and extracted the 16 constitutional principles that govern all feature design:

  **Applicable Constitutional Gates for F-2 (Event Logging Library):**

  | Principle | Relevance to F-2 |
  |-----------|------------------|
  | **#5: As Deterministic as Possible** | Same input → same output. Event logging must be predictable and repeatable. |
  | **#6: Code Before Prompts** | TypeScript library, no AI prompting needed for logging. |
  | **#7: Spec / Test / Evals First** | Spec exists (from F-1). Tests must be written before implementation. |
  | **#8: UNIX Philosophy** | Single purpose - emit events to JSONL. Composable via standard I/O. |
  | **#9: ENG / SRE Principles** | Version control, monitoring, graceful degradation, fail-safe design. |
  | **#10: CLI as Interface** | Library should support CLI invocation for testing. |
  | **#11: Goal → Code → CLI → Prompts → Agents** | This is pure code layer - no prompts/agents needed. |

  **Key Constraints Identified:**
  - Must serialize to JSON without data loss (no Date objects, Maps, Sets)
  - Fire-and-forget design - logging must never block execution
  - Must handle concurrent writes safely (multiple agents writing simultaneously)
  - Must support the PAIEvent schema defined in F-1

### 2. Check Current Status

- [ ] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

- [ ] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)

### 3. Create Specification

- [ ] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [ ] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | |
| Requirements are atomic | |
| No ambiguity | |
| Dependencies identified | |

- [ ] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | | |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | | |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | | |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [ ] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```

- [ ] **Confirm phase is "specify"**

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present spec to human for review before proceeding.

Show:
1. `spec.md` requirements
2. Feature description and rationale

**Only proceed to Step 2 after human approval.**
