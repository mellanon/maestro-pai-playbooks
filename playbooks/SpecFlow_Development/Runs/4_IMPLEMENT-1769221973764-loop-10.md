# Step 4: IMPLEMENT - TDD Execution

**Phase**: Implementation | **Loop**: Repeats until all tasks complete

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Implement the next task using TDD (Test-Driven Development).

## Prerequisites

- Tasks approved (tasks.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "tasks" or "implement"
- **State directory exists** (create if needed):
  ```bash
  mkdir -p .maestro/outputs
  ```

## Instructions

### 1. Get Implementation Context

- [x] **Get next task context**:
  ```bash
  specflow implement
  ```

  Or for a specific feature:
  ```bash
  specflow implement --feature <feature-id>
  ```

  This outputs:
  - Feature spec
  - Technical plan
  - Tasks with current progress
  - Implementation prompt for AI

### 2. TDD Cycle: RED

- [x] **Write failing test first**:
  - Create test file if doesn't exist
  - Write test for the current task's acceptance criteria
  - Run tests to confirm failure (RED state)

  *Created `Observability/__tests__/watchdog.test.sh` with 33 bash tests covering script structure, configuration, function definitions, health check logic, state management, heartbeat, notifications, logging, and exit codes. Also added 8 tests to `Observability/manage.test.ts` for watchdog commands.*

- [x] **Record test creation** in `.maestro/outputs/LOOP_PROGRESS.md`:
  ```markdown
  ## Task: [task name]
  ### Tests Written
  * test_xxx: [description]
  ```

  *Updated LOOP_PROGRESS.md with comprehensive test listing.*

### 3. TDD Cycle: GREEN

- [x] **Implement minimal code** to make tests pass:
  - Focus only on current task
  - Don't over-engineer
  - Follow the plan.md architecture

  *Implementation was already complete from prior loops. One test needed adjustment (VoiceServer integration test was looking for literal string but script uses variable).*

- [x] **Run tests** to confirm passing (GREEN state):
  ```bash
  bun test
  # or project-specific test command
  ```

  *All 425 tests passing (including 33 bash tests and 8 new TypeScript tests for watchdog commands).*

### 4. TDD Cycle: REFACTOR (if needed)

- [x] **Clean up code** while keeping tests green:
  - Remove duplication
  - Improve naming
  - Keep it simple

  *Fixed test assertion in watchdog.test.sh to check for VOICE_SERVER_PORT variable and /notify endpoint instead of literal URL. Added explicit watchdog.log entry to .gitignore as required by spec.*

### 5. Update Progress

- [x] **Update progress file**:
  ```markdown
  ### Implementation
  - Files created: [list]
  - Files modified: [list]
  - Tests passing: [count]
  ```

  *Updated `.maestro/outputs/LOOP_PROGRESS.md` with files created (Observability/__tests__/watchdog.test.sh), files modified (Observability/manage.test.ts, .gitignore), and test counts (bash: 33/33, TypeScript: 425/425).*

## Output

- New/modified source files
- New/modified test files
- `.maestro/outputs/LOOP_PROGRESS.md` updated
