# Step 4: IMPLEMENT - TDD Execution

**Phase**: Implementation | **Loop**: Repeats until all tasks complete

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Implement the next task using TDD (Test-Driven Development).

## Prerequisites

- Tasks approved (tasks.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "tasks" or "implement"
- **State directory exists** (create if needed):
  ```bash
  mkdir -p .maestro/outputs
  ```

## Instructions

### 1. Get Implementation Context

- [x] **Get next task context**:

> **Loop 14 Result:** `specflow implement` → "No pending features. All features are complete or skipped."
> - 16 features total | 15 complete | 1 skipped (F-12)
> - 394 tests passing
> - **ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE** - No implementation work remaining
  ```bash
  specflow implement
  ```

  Or for a specific feature:
  ```bash
  specflow implement --feature <feature-id>
  ```

  This outputs:
  - Feature spec
  - Technical plan
  - Tasks with current progress
  - Implementation prompt for AI

### 2. TDD Cycle: RED

- [x] **Write failing test first**: *(N/A - ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)*
  - Create test file if doesn't exist
  - Write test for the current task's acceptance criteria
  - Run tests to confirm failure (RED state)

- [x] **Record test creation** in `.maestro/outputs/LOOP_PROGRESS.md`: *(N/A - ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)*
  ```markdown
  ## Task: [task name]
  ### Tests Written
  * test_xxx: [description]
  ```

### 3. TDD Cycle: GREEN

- [x] **Implement minimal code** to make tests pass: *(N/A - ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)*
  - Focus only on current task
  - Don't over-engineer
  - Follow the plan.md architecture

- [x] **Run tests** to confirm passing (GREEN state): *(N/A - ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)*
  ```bash
  bun test
  # or project-specific test command
  ```

### 4. TDD Cycle: REFACTOR (if needed)

- [x] **Clean up code** while keeping tests green: *(N/A - ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)*
  - Remove duplication
  - Improve naming
  - Keep it simple

### 5. Update Progress

- [x] **Update progress file**: *(N/A - ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)*
  ```markdown
  ### Implementation
  - Files created: [list]
  - Files modified: [list]
  - Tests passing: [count]
  ```

## Output

- New/modified source files
- New/modified test files
- `.maestro/outputs/LOOP_PROGRESS.md` updated

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 5 (VERIFY) to check progress and loop control

## Loop 14 Final Summary

**Status:** ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE ✅

**Verification Results:**
- `specflow implement` → "No pending features. All features are complete or skipped."
- `bun test` → 394 tests passing (0 failures)
- 16 features total: 15 complete, 1 skipped (F-12)

**Action:** TDD steps 2-5 marked as N/A since no implementation work remains. Proceeding to Step 5 VERIFY for final validation and playbook completion.
