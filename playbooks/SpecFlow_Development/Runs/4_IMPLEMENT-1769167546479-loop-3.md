# Step 4: IMPLEMENT - TDD Execution

**Phase**: Implementation | **Loop**: Repeats until all tasks complete

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Implement the next task using TDD (Test-Driven Development).

## Prerequisites

- Tasks approved (tasks.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "tasks" or "implement"
- **State directory exists** (create if needed):
  ```bash
  mkdir -p .maestro/outputs
  ```

## Instructions

### 1. Get Implementation Context

- [x] **Get next task context** (T-1.2: Lock acquisition and release):
  ```bash
  specflow implement
  ```

  Or for a specific feature:
  ```bash
  specflow implement --feature <feature-id>
  ```

  This outputs:
  - Feature spec
  - Technical plan
  - Tasks with current progress
  - Implementation prompt for AI

### 2. TDD Cycle: RED

- [x] **Write failing test first**:
  - Created 10 new tests for acquireLock() and releaseLock()
  - Ran tests - all 10 new tests failed (RED state confirmed)

- [x] **Record test creation** in `.maestro/outputs/LOOP_PROGRESS.md`:
  ```markdown
  ## Task: [task name]
  ### Tests Written
  - [ ] test_xxx: [description]
  ```

### 3. TDD Cycle: GREEN

- [x] **Implement minimal code** to make tests pass:
  - Implemented acquireLock() using atomic writeFileSync with 'wx' flag
  - Implemented releaseLock() using unlinkSync with graceful error handling
  - Lock file mode 0600, contains LockContent JSON

- [x] **Run tests** to confirm passing (GREEN state): 22/22 lock tests, 153/153 all event tests
  ```bash
  bun test
  # or project-specific test command
  ```

### 4. TDD Cycle: REFACTOR (if needed)

- [x] **Clean up code** while keeping tests green:
  - Skipped refactor - implementation is minimal and clean

### 5. Update Progress

- [x] **Update progress file**:
  - Files modified: `Observability/lib/events/lock.ts`, `Observability/lib/events/lock.test.ts`
  - Tests passing: 22/22 (lock module), 153/153 (all events)
  - Updated `.maestro/outputs/LOOP_PROGRESS.md` with T-1.2 progress
  - Updated `.specify/specs/f-3-concurrent-write-handling/tasks.md` with T-1.2 ☑

## Output

- New/modified source files
- New/modified test files
- `.maestro/outputs/LOOP_PROGRESS.md` updated
