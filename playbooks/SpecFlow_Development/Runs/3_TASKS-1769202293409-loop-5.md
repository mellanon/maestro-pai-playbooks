# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

  **Verified:** F-9 is in phase `③ tasks` (tasks already created). Plan exists at `.specify/specs/f-9-hook-timing-instrumentation/plan.md`.

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

  **Verified:** Tasks already created at `.specify/specs/f-9-hook-timing-instrumentation/tasks.md` with 6 implementation tasks (T-1.1 through T-3.1), all marked complete.

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`):

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | ✓ (each task has test file/verification) |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | ✓ (checkboxes in each task) |
| Dependencies are explicit | ✓ (listed in each task block) |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | ✓ (Group 1 → Group 2 → Group 3) |

- [x] **Check task granularity**:
  - [x] No task is too large (can be done in one session)
  - [x] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped)
  - [x] Each task has a verifiable outcome

  **Verified:** 6 tasks total, appropriately scoped. Implementation verified with 20 passing tests.

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `③ tasks`

  **Verified:** F-9 shows phase `③ tasks`. All implementation tasks (T-1.1 through T-3.1) are complete:
  - hook-timer.ts created with HookTimer class
  - hook-timer.test.ts with 20 passing tests
  - HookTimer exported from index.ts
  - TypeScript compilation verified
  - Import test passes

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 4 (IMPLEMENT) to begin TDD implementation.
