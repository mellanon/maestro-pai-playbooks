# Step 6: COMPLETE - Validation and Finalization

**Phase**: Completion | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Validate all phases complete and mark the feature as done.

## Prerequisites

- All tests passing
- All tasks complete
- Step 5 loop control indicates completion

## Instructions

### 1. Final Validation

- [x] **Run comprehensive validation**: ✅ `specflow validate F-016` passed - all specs valid (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, docs.md present)

### 2. Run Final Tests

- [x] **Execute full test suite**: ✅ 394 tests passing across 12 files (bun test)

- [x] **Run type checking** (if applicable): ⏭️ No tsconfig.json - Bun handles TypeScript natively

### 3. Mark Feature Complete

- [x] **Complete the feature**: ✅ All 16 features already marked complete in specflow database

### 4. Review Doctorow Gate

The `specflow complete` command includes the **Doctorow Gate** - a checklist ensuring quality:

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Tests exist and pass | ✅ 394 tests |
| No unnecessary complexity added | ✅ |
| Code follows existing patterns | ✅ |
| Documentation updated if needed | ✅ |

### 5. Verify Completion

- [x] **Check final status**: ✅ `specflow status` shows 100% complete (16/16 features)

### 6. Update Changelog

- [x] **Generate changelog entry from spec**: ✅ All 15 implemented features documented

- [x] **Update CHANGELOG.md**: ✅ CHANGELOG.md already contains comprehensive entries for all features

### 7. Sanitization Checklist

Before creating PR, verify no sensitive data is included.

- [x] **Check for secrets**: ✅ Only documentation examples found (telegram-setup.md, daemon-setup.md, etc.) - no real credentials

- [x] **Check for personal paths**: ✅ Only in spec documentation examples and test fixtures - no production hardcoded paths

- [x] **Check for hardcoded usernames**: ✅ Only placeholder examples in documentation (your-username, your-email@example.com)

- [x] **Verify config externalized**:
  - [x] Secrets in `.env` files (not committed) ✅
  - [x] No hardcoded credentials in source ✅

### 8. Create File Inventory

- [x] **List files for PR** in `.maestro/outputs/FILE_INVENTORY.md`: ✅ Already exists with 143 files documented

  ```markdown
  ## File Inventory

  ### Include (✅)
  | File | Reason |
  |------|--------|
  | `src/feature.ts` | Core implementation |
  | `test/feature.test.ts` | Test coverage |
  | `docs/feature.md` | Documentation |

  ### Exclude (❌)
  | Path | Reason |
  |------|--------|
  | `.env` | Contains secrets |
  | `test/fixtures/` | May contain PII |
  ```

### 9. Prepare for Next Feature

- [x] **Check if more features pending**: ✅ `specflow next` returns "All features complete or no pending features."

## Output

- ✅ Feature marked complete in database
- ✅ `CHANGELOG.md` updated with feature entry
- ✅ `.maestro/outputs/FILE_INVENTORY.md` with PR file list
- ✅ `.maestro/outputs/COMPLETION.md` summary

## Post-Completion

When ready to release:
```bash
# Stage changes
git add <specific files>

# Create commit
git commit -m "feat: [feature description]

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create --title "[title]" --body "..."
```

## Optional: Self-Review with PR_Review Playbook

After creating the PR, optionally run the **PR_Review** playbook for self-review.

## Feature Loop: Initialize Next Feature

After completing a feature, the playbook MUST check for and initialize the next feature.

### 10. Clear Current Feature State

- [x] **Archive completed feature context**: ✅ CURRENT_FEATURE.md already contains `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE` marker with full summary

### 11. Check for Next Feature

- [x] **List remaining pending features (by ID order)**: ✅ No pending features - ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE

  **Result:** NO features remain. CURRENT_FEATURE.md already contains:
  ```markdown
  # Current Feature
  ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE

  All 16 features have been implemented successfully. Playbook complete.
  Date: 2026-01-24
  ```

### 12. Initialize Next Feature

- [x] **Create new CURRENT_FEATURE.md for next feature**: ⏭️ N/A - ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE, no next feature

- [x] **Check if feature needs spec initialization**: ⏭️ N/A - no pending features

### 13. Reset Playbook for Next Feature

- [x] **Clear loop artifacts from previous feature**: ⏭️ N/A - playbook complete, artifacts preserved for PR

- [x] **Log feature transition**: ⏭️ N/A - final state, no transition needed

## Loop Control

After completing Tasks 10-13, the playbook loops back to **Step 0 (SELECT_FEATURE)** to begin the next feature cycle.

**Loop continues until:**
- All features are complete (`specflow list --status pending` returns empty)
- Max loops reached (configurable in Maestro)
- Manual stop by user

---

## Playbook Complete (Final Exit)

The playbook only exits when `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` contains `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE`.

At that point:
1. All features have been implemented
2. PR_Review playbook can be run for final review
3. Session ends
