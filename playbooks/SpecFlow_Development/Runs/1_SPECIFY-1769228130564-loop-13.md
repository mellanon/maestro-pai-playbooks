# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ **Loop 13:** SpecFlow is fully initialized with 16 features (15 complete, 1 skipped).

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.

  ✅ **Loop 13:** Already initialized. Project has 16 features decomposed from requirements.

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles

  ✅ **Loop 13:** N/A - All features already specified and implemented. Constitutional gates were validated during prior feature development loops.

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ **Loop 13:** Status shows 94% complete (15/16 features, 1 intentionally skipped).

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)

  ✅ **Loop 13:** CURRENT_FEATURE.md shows `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE`. No pending features remain.

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```

  ✅ **Loop 13:** N/A - No features pending specification. All 15 implemented features have existing specs.

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ |
| No ambiguity | ✅ |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ |

✅ **Loop 13:** N/A - All specs were validated during their respective development loops. 394 tests passing confirms testability.

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | ✅ | ✅ |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | ✅ | ✅ |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | ✅ | ✅ |

✅ **Loop 13:** All principles were validated during implementation.

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```
  ✅ **Loop 13:** All features verified as complete or intentionally skipped.

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  ✅ **Loop 13:** ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE - No features in specify phase. Playbook has reached completion.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

## Loop 13 Summary

**Status:** ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE

All specification work is done:
- **16 total features** in the system
- **15 features complete** with full spec → plan → tasks → implement cycle
- **1 feature skipped** (F-12 Vector Configuration - intentionally deferred)
- **394 tests passing**

No further specification work required. The playbook has successfully completed all feature development.

## Next

→ Playbook complete. Consider:
1. Creating a PR for the feature branch
2. Running PR_Review playbook for self-review
3. Merging to main
