# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec: *(Already initialized - 16 features in queue)*
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase: *(docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md does not exist in this PAI project)*

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  **Result**: 16 features | 15 complete | 0 in progress | 0 pending | 1 skipped | Progress: 94%

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  **Result**: ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE - No pending features to specify.

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature: *(N/A - All features already complete)*

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`: *(N/A - No new specifications to validate)*

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**: *(N/A - No new designs to validate)*

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**: ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE confirmed via `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**: *(SPECIFY phase complete - all features are in implement phase or skipped)*

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database
