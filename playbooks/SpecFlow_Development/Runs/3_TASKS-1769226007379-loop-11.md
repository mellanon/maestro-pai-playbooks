# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

  **NOTE (Loop 11):** All 15 features are already COMPLETE (phase ④ implement). The playbook has finished - `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE` was marked in Loop 10. No features remain in plan phase.

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

  **NOTE (Loop 11):** N/A - all tasks already created and implemented in previous loops.

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`):

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | ✓ |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | ✓ |
| Dependencies are explicit | ✓ |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | ✓ |

**NOTE (Loop 11):** All tasks were validated in previous loops. 394 tests passing confirms TDD pattern was followed.

- [x] **Check task granularity**:
  - [x] No task is too large (can be done in one session)
  - [x] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped)
  - [x] Each task has a verifiable outcome

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `③ tasks`

  **FINAL STATUS (Loop 11):**
  ```
  16 features | 15 complete | 0 in progress | 0 pending | 1 skipped
  Progress: 94%
  ```
  All features are in phase ④ implement (complete). Playbook finished.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Next

→ **PLAYBOOK COMPLETE** - All features implemented and verified. No further action required.
