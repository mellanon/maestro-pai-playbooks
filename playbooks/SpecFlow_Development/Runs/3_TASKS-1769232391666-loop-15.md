# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

  **Status:** All 16 features are at 100% complete in phase `④ implement`. No features are in the `② plan` phase that need task breakdown. The TASKS step is not applicable for this run - all work has been completed in previous loops.

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

  **N/A - Loop 15:** All 16 features are already complete at `④ implement` phase. No features require task breakdown.

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`):

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | |
| Dependencies are explicit | |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | |

  **N/A - Loop 15:** All features already completed. Task quality was validated in previous loops.

- [x] **Check task granularity**:
  - [x] No task is too large (can be done in one session)
  - [x] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped)
  - [x] Each task has a verifiable outcome

  **N/A - Loop 15:** All features already completed.

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `③ tasks`

  **Verified Loop 15:** All 16 features are at `④ implement` phase with 100% completion. TASKS step is complete for all features.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 4 (IMPLEMENT) to begin TDD implementation.
