# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**: ✅ Verified - 16 features loaded, 9 complete
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec: ✅ N/A - Already initialized
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase: ✅ Read PAISYSTEMARCHITECTURE.md - Key principles: Deterministic (P5), Code Before Prompts (P6), CLI Interface (P10), UNIX Philosophy (P8)
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**: ✅ F-9 (Hook Timing Instrumentation) is the current target from CURRENT_FEATURE.md
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending): ✅ F-9 Hook Timing Instrumentation

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature: ✅ Created spec.md with TimingContext class design, 5 hooks to instrument, and full constitutional validation
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`: ✅ Validated in spec

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ Each success criterion maps to verifiable test |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ TimingContext class, clear event types |
| No ambiguity | ✅ Code examples show exact implementation |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ F-1, F-2 clearly stated as upstream |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**: ✅ Validated in spec

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | ✅ Yes | ✅ Timing is deterministic |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | ✅ Yes | ✅ Events queryable via CLI |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Single purpose: timing |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**: ✅ F-9 is now in "specify" phase
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**: ✅ Confirmed via `specflow status`

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

→ Proceed to Step 2 (PLAN) to create technical architecture.
