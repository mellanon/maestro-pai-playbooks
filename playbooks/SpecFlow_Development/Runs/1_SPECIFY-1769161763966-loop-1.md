# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  ✅ **CONFIRMED INITIALIZED** - `.specflow/features.db` exists with 15 features:
  - F-1: Event Schema and Types (complete)
  - F-2: Event Logging Library (pending, next feature)
  - F-3 through F-15: Various pending features

  Current feature set via `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`: **F-2 Event Logging Library**

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:

  ✅ **SKIPPED** - Already initialized (see above)

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles

  ✅ **COMPLETED** - PAI principles reviewed from `skills/CORE/SKILL.md`:
  - Determinism: logEvent() uses synchronous file append
  - CLI-first: Events stored in JSONL for standard CLI tool processing (jq, grep, cat)
  - UNIX philosophy: Single function, single purpose (write events to disk)

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  sqlite3 .specflow/features.db "SELECT id, name, status, phase FROM features ORDER BY CAST(SUBSTR(id, 3) AS INTEGER);"
  ```

  ✅ **COMPLETED** - 15 features in queue:
  - F-1: Event Schema and Types (complete, phase=implement)
  - F-2: Event Logging Library (pending → specify)
  - F-3 through F-15: Various pending features

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)

  ✅ **COMPLETED** - Target feature: **F-2 Event Logging Library**

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:

  ✅ **COMPLETED** - spec.md created at:
  ```
  .specify/specs/f-2-event-logging-library/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements (8 FRs, 4 NFRs, 3 DDs)
  ```

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ Each FR has validation criteria |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ 8 distinct functional requirements |
| No ambiguity | ✅ Specific function signatures, error handling |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ F-1 dependency documented |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | ✅ Yes | ✅ Synchronous file append |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | ✅ Yes | ✅ JSONL format for CLI tools |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Single function: logEvent() |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  sqlite3 .specflow/features.db "SELECT id, name, status, phase FROM features WHERE id = 'F-2';"
  ```

  ✅ **Result:** `F-2|Event Logging Library|pending|specify`

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**

  ✅ **CONFIRMED** - Database updated, phase is now "specify"

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present spec to human for review before proceeding.

Show:
1. `spec.md` requirements
2. Feature description and rationale

**Only proceed to Step 2 after human approval.**
