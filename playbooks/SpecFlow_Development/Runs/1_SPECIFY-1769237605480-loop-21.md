# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  **Result (Loop 21):** SpecFlow is initialized. Status shows ALL 16 FEATURES COMPLETE (100% progress). No pending features remain to specify.

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.

  **Result (Loop 21):** N/A - SpecFlow already initialized. All 16 features complete (100%).

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles

  **Result (Loop 21):** N/A - No new features to specify. All features have passed through this phase.

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  **Result (Loop 21):** Status confirmed - 16 features | 16 complete | 0 in progress | 0 pending | 0 skipped. Progress: 100%

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)

  **Result (Loop 21):** No next feature - all 16 features are complete. No pending features remain.

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```

  **Result (Loop 21):** N/A - All features already have specifications. No new features to specify.

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ (all features implemented and tested) |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ (all features completed) |
| No ambiguity | ✅ (all features implemented successfully) |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ (all features completed in dependency order) |

  **Result (Loop 21):** All 16 features have passed implementation phase, confirming spec quality was sufficient.

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | ✅ | ✅ |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | ✅ | ✅ |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | ✅ | ✅ |

  **Result (Loop 21):** All principles validated through successful implementation of all 16 features.

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```

  **Result (Loop 21):** All 16 features show status "complete" at phase "implement".

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**

  **Result (Loop 21):** ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE - SPECIFY phase has nothing to do. All 16 features have completed the full pipeline (specify → plan → tasks → implement).

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 2 (PLAN) to create technical architecture.
