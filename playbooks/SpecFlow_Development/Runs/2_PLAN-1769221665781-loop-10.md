# Step 2: PLAN - Create Technical Architecture

**Phase**: Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Create a technical architecture plan including data models, failure modes, and design decisions.

## Prerequisites

- Specification approved (spec.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "specify"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify spec exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `① specify`

  ✅ Verified: F-13 Vector Health Watchdog was in `① specify` phase with spec.md at `.specify/specs/f-13-vector-health-watchdog/spec.md`

### 2. Create Technical Plan

- [x] **Run the plan phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow plan <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow plan F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  └── plan.md      ← Architecture decisions
  ```

  ✅ Executed: `specflow plan F-13` - Created comprehensive plan at `.specify/specs/f-13-vector-health-watchdog/plan.md`

### 3. Validate Plan Quality

- [x] **Check plan covers**:

| Section | Included? |
|---------|-----------|
| Data models | ✅ Heartbeat (JSON), State (key-value), Log formats |
| API/Interface design | ✅ Health endpoints, VoiceServer POST, ntfy POST |
| Error handling strategy | ✅ Fire-and-forget, timeouts, atomic writes |
| Failure modes | ✅ Full table with 8 failure scenarios |
| Dependencies | ✅ External (curl, jq, launchctl) and PAI (F-11, F-15, VoiceServer) |
| Testing strategy | ✅ 5 manual test scenarios + verification commands |

- [x] **Check design against PAI principles**:

| Principle | Applied? |
|-----------|----------|
| Code before prompts | ✅ Pure bash, no AI/prompt involvement |
| Deterministic where possible | ✅ Fixed intervals, atomic state transitions, clear exit codes |
| CLI-first interfaces | ✅ manage.sh watchdog-status/install/uninstall commands |

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `② plan`

  ✅ Verified: F-13 now shows `② plan` phase

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/plan.md` with technical architecture
- Feature phase updated to "plan"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 3 (TASKS) to break down implementation units.
