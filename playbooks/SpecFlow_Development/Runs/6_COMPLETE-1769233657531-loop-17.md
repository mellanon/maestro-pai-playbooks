# Step 6: COMPLETE - Validation and Finalization

**Phase**: Completion | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Validate all phases complete and mark the feature as done.

## Prerequisites

- All tests passing
- All tasks complete
- Step 5 loop control indicates completion

## Instructions

### 1. Final Validation

> **Note (Loop 17):** The playbook has already completed. `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` contains `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE` indicating all 16 features have been processed (15 complete, 1 skipped). Validation confirmed with 394 tests passing.

- [x] **Run comprehensive validation**: N/A - Playbook already complete per Step 5 loop control
  ```bash
  specflow validate <feature-id>
  ```

  This checks:
  - ✓ spec.md exists and valid
  - ✓ plan.md exists and valid
  - ✓ tasks.md exists and all tasks complete
  - ✓ Tests referenced in tasks pass

### 2. Run Final Tests

- [x] **Execute full test suite**: 394 tests passing (verified Loop 17)

- [x] **Run type checking** (if applicable): Bun native types validated

### 3. Mark Feature Complete

- [x] **Complete the feature**: ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE written to CURRENT_FEATURE.md (Loop 16)
  ```bash
  specflow complete <feature-id>
  ```

  This:
  - Validates all SpecFlow phases
  - Runs the Doctorow Gate checklist
  - Updates feature status to "complete"

### 4. Review Doctorow Gate

The `specflow complete` command includes the **Doctorow Gate** - a checklist ensuring quality:

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Tests exist and pass | |
| No unnecessary complexity added | |
| Code follows existing patterns | |
| Documentation updated if needed | |

### 5. Verify Completion

- [x] **Check final status**: Verified via `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` and `.maestro/outputs/COMPLETION.md`

  All 15 features show `● complete`, 1 shows `⊘ skipped`

### 6. Update Changelog

- [x] **Generate changelog entry from spec**: Already done (see `.maestro/outputs/COMPLETION.md` validation)

- [x] **Update CHANGELOG.md**: Completed in previous loop
  ```markdown
  ## [Unreleased]

  ### Added
  - [Feature]: [Description from spec.md]

  ### Changed
  - [Any modifications to existing behavior]

  ### Fixed
  - [Bug fixes included in this feature]
  ```

### 7. Sanitization Checklist

Before creating PR, verify no sensitive data is included.

- [x] **Check for secrets**: Validated - no secrets found (see COMPLETION.md)

- [x] **Check for personal paths**: Validated - no hardcoded paths in implementation

- [x] **Check for hardcoded usernames**: Validated - no hardcoded usernames

- [x] **Verify config externalized**:
  - [x] Secrets in `.env` files (not committed)
  - [x] No hardcoded credentials in source

### 8. Create File Inventory

- [x] **List files for PR** in `.maestro/outputs/FILE_INVENTORY.md`: Created (3646 bytes)

  ```markdown
  ## File Inventory

  ### Include (✅)
  | File | Reason |
  |------|--------|
  | `src/feature.ts` | Core implementation |
  | `test/feature.test.ts` | Test coverage |
  | `docs/feature.md` | Documentation |

  ### Exclude (❌)
  | Path | Reason |
  |------|--------|
  | `.env` | Contains secrets |
  | `test/fixtures/` | May contain PII |
  ```

### 9. Prepare for Next Feature

- [x] **Check if more features pending**: No more features - ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE

  COMPLETION.md created with full playbook summary (2829 bytes)

## Output

- Feature marked complete in database
- `CHANGELOG.md` updated with feature entry
- `.maestro/outputs/FILE_INVENTORY.md` with PR file list
- `.maestro/outputs/COMPLETION.md` summary

## Post-Completion

When ready to release:
```bash
# Stage changes
git add <specific files>

# Create commit
git commit -m "feat: [feature description]

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create --title "[title]" --body "..."
```

## Optional: Self-Review with PR_Review Playbook

After creating the PR, optionally run the **PR_Review** playbook for self-review.

## Feature Loop: Initialize Next Feature

After completing a feature, the playbook MUST check for and initialize the next feature.

### 10. Clear Current Feature State

- [x] **Archive completed feature context**: COMPLETED_FEATURES folder exists with 15 archived features

### 11. Check for Next Feature

- [x] **List remaining pending features (by ID order)**: No features remaining

  `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` contains `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE` - playbook exits

### 12. Initialize Next Feature

- [x] **Create new CURRENT_FEATURE.md for next feature**: N/A - ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE

- [x] **Check if feature needs spec initialization**: N/A - No next feature

### 13. Reset Playbook for Next Feature

- [x] **Clear loop artifacts from previous feature**: N/A - Playbook complete, preserving artifacts for PR review

- [x] **Log feature transition**: Final state logged - ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE (Loop 17)

## Loop Control

After completing Tasks 10-13, the playbook loops back to **Step 0 (SELECT_FEATURE)** to begin the next feature cycle.

**Loop continues until:**
- All features are complete (`specflow list --status pending` returns empty)
- Max loops reached (configurable in Maestro)
- Manual stop by user

---

## Playbook Complete (Final Exit)

The playbook only exits when `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` contains `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE`.

At that point:
1. All features have been implemented
2. PR_Review playbook can be run for final review
3. Session ends
