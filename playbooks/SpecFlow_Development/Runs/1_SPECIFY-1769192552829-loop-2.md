# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  **COMPLETED (2026-01-24):** SpecFlow is initialized with 16 features, 6 complete, 10 pending. Current feature F-6 (SessionStop Hook Instrumentation) identified from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`.

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.

  **SKIPPED (2026-01-24):** N/A - SpecFlow is already initialized with 16 features (6 complete, 10 pending). Current feature F-6 (SessionStop Hook Instrumentation) is in the specify phase.

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles

  **COMPLETED (2026-01-24):** Read `skills/CORE/SYSTEM/PAISYSTEMARCHITECTURE.md` which contains the founding principles (the `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` path doesn't exist - principles are in the PAISYSTEMARCHITECTURE document). Validated F-6 spec against principles - see validation in Step 4.

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  **COMPLETED (2026-01-24):** Ran `~/bin/specflow status`. Shows 16 features: 6 complete, 10 pending. F-6 (SessionStop Hook Instrumentation) is in phase "specify" with priority 4.

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)

  **COMPLETED (2026-01-24):** Confirmed F-6 (SessionStop Hook Instrumentation) is the current feature from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`. The SPECIFY phase was already completed on 2026-01-24 with spec.md created at `.specify/specs/f-6-sessionstop-hook-instrumentation/spec.md`.

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```

  **COMPLETED (2026-01-24):** Spec already exists at `.specify/specs/f-6-sessionstop-hook-instrumentation/spec.md`. Verified spec contains:
  - 4 User Scenarios with acceptance criteria
  - 7 Functional Requirements (FR-1 through FR-7)
  - Non-Functional Requirements (performance, reliability, security)
  - Key Entities, Dependencies, Success Criteria, and Assumptions sections
  - Follows F-5 (SessionStart) pattern for consistency

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [ ] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | |
| Requirements are atomic | |
| No ambiguity | |
| Dependencies identified | |

- [ ] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | | |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | | |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | | |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [ ] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```

- [ ] **Confirm phase is "specify"**

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database
