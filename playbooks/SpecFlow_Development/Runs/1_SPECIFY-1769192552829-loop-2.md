# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  **COMPLETED (2026-01-24):** SpecFlow is initialized with 16 features, 6 complete, 10 pending. Current feature F-6 (SessionStop Hook Instrumentation) identified from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`.

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.

  **SKIPPED (2026-01-24):** N/A - SpecFlow is already initialized with 16 features (6 complete, 10 pending). Current feature F-6 (SessionStop Hook Instrumentation) is in the specify phase.

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles

  **COMPLETED (2026-01-24):** Read `skills/CORE/SYSTEM/PAISYSTEMARCHITECTURE.md` which contains the founding principles (the `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` path doesn't exist - principles are in the PAISYSTEMARCHITECTURE document). Validated F-6 spec against principles - see validation in Step 4.

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  **COMPLETED (2026-01-24):** Ran `~/bin/specflow status`. Shows 16 features: 6 complete, 10 pending. F-6 (SessionStop Hook Instrumentation) is in phase "specify" with priority 4.

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)

  **COMPLETED (2026-01-24):** Confirmed F-6 (SessionStop Hook Instrumentation) is the current feature from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`. The SPECIFY phase was already completed on 2026-01-24 with spec.md created at `.specify/specs/f-6-sessionstop-hook-instrumentation/spec.md`.

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```

  **COMPLETED (2026-01-24):** Spec already exists at `.specify/specs/f-6-sessionstop-hook-instrumentation/spec.md`. Verified spec contains:
  - 4 User Scenarios with acceptance criteria
  - 7 Functional Requirements (FR-1 through FR-7)
  - Non-Functional Requirements (performance, reliability, security)
  - Key Entities, Dependencies, Success Criteria, and Assumptions sections
  - Follows F-5 (SessionStart) pattern for consistency

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ Each FR has explicit validation criteria with unit/integration tests |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ FR-1 through FR-7 are single-responsibility functions |
| No ambiguity | ✅ Code samples provided for each FR, clear constraints defined |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ Upstream (F-1, F-2, F-4, F-5, TranscriptParser) and downstream (CLI, Grafana, Cost Analysis) listed |

  **COMPLETED (2026-01-24):** Note: `docs/TDD-EVALS.md` doesn't exist; validated using standard TDD criteria. All 7 FRs pass testability, atomicity, clarity, and dependency checks.

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred (P5) | Yes | ✅ Event structure deterministic, defaults to 0 for missing data |
| CLI interfaces where applicable (P10) | Yes | ✅ Events queryable via CLI tools, JSONL format |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) (P8) | Yes | ✅ Handler has single purpose: emit session.end event |
| Code Before Prompts (P6) | Yes | ✅ Pure TypeScript, no AI prompting required |
| Spec/Test/Evals First (P7) | Yes | ✅ Validation criteria defined before implementation |
| Fire-and-forget (P9 - SRE principles) | Yes | ✅ FR-7 explicitly requires fire-and-forget pattern |

  **COMPLETED (2026-01-24):** Principles validated from `skills/CORE/SYSTEM/PAISYSTEMARCHITECTURE.md` (the actual location). F-6 spec adheres to all applicable PAI founding principles.

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```

  **COMPLETED (2026-01-24):** Ran `~/bin/specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="F-6")'`. Result shows:
  - id: "F-6"
  - name: "SessionStop Hook Instrumentation"
  - phase: "specify"
  - priority: 4
  - specPath: `.specify/specs/f-6-sessionstop-hook-instrumentation`

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**

  **COMPLETED (2026-01-24):** Confirmed. F-6 is in phase "specify" with spec.md created and validated. Ready to proceed to Step 2 (PLAN).

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 2 (PLAN) to create technical architecture.
