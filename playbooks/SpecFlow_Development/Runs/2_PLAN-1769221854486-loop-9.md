# Step 2: PLAN - Create Technical Architecture

**Phase**: Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Create a technical architecture plan including data models, failure modes, and design decisions.

## Prerequisites

- Specification approved (spec.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "specify"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify spec exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `① specify`

  ✅ **Completed:** F-13 (Vector Health Watchdog) was in phase `① specify` with spec.md at `.specify/specs/f-13-vector-health-watchdog/spec.md`

### 2. Create Technical Plan

- [x] **Run the plan phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow plan <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow plan F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  └── plan.md      ← Architecture decisions
  ```

  ✅ **Completed:** Ran `specflow plan F-13`. Created comprehensive plan at `.specify/specs/f-13-vector-health-watchdog/plan.md` with 5 implementation phases, state machine design, architecture diagram, and risk assessment.

### 3. Validate Plan Quality

- [x] **Check plan covers**:

| Section | Included? |
|---------|-----------|
| Data models | ✅ State machine (HEALTHY, DEGRADED, FAILED) |
| API/Interface design | ✅ Script interface with --once, --install, --uninstall |
| Error handling strategy | ✅ Graceful degradation for missing Telegram credentials |
| Failure modes | ✅ Risk assessment with 7 failure modes and mitigations |
| Dependencies | ✅ Upstream (F-11, F-15, curl, launchd) and downstream |
| Testing strategy | ✅ Unit, integration, and launchd tests defined |

- [x] **Check design against PAI principles**:

| Principle | Applied? |
|-----------|----------|
| Code before prompts | ✅ Bash script, no LLM calls |
| Deterministic where possible | ✅ Explicit state machine, no randomness |
| CLI-first interfaces | ✅ All operations via command-line flags |

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `② plan`

  ✅ **Verified:** F-13 now shows `◐ in_progress ② plan`. Phase transition successful.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/plan.md` with technical architecture
- Feature phase updated to "plan"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 3 (TASKS) to break down implementation units.
