# Step 6: COMPLETE - Validation and Finalization

**Phase**: Completion | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Validate all phases complete and mark the feature as done.

## Prerequisites

- All tests passing
- All tasks complete
- Step 5 loop control indicates completion

## Instructions

### 1. Final Validation

- [x] **Run comprehensive validation**: *(All 16 features validated in previous loops)*

  This checks:
  - ✓ spec.md exists and valid
  - ✓ plan.md exists and valid
  - ✓ tasks.md exists and all tasks complete
  - ✓ Tests referenced in tasks pass

### 2. Run Final Tests

- [x] **Execute full test suite**: *(460 tests passing, 1402 expect() calls)*

- [x] **Run type checking** (if applicable): *(TypeScript checks pass)*

### 3. Mark Feature Complete

- [x] **Complete the feature**: *(All 16 features complete)*

  This:
  - Validates all SpecFlow phases
  - Runs the Doctorow Gate checklist
  - Updates feature status to "complete"

### 4. Review Doctorow Gate

The `specflow complete` command includes the **Doctorow Gate** - a checklist ensuring quality:

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Tests exist and pass | ✅ |
| No unnecessary complexity added | ✅ |
| Code follows existing patterns | ✅ |
| Documentation updated if needed | ✅ |

### 5. Verify Completion

- [x] **Check final status**: *(CURRENT_FEATURE.md shows ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)*

  Feature should show: `● complete`

### 6. Update Changelog

- [x] **Generate changelog entry from spec**: *(All 16 features documented)*

- [x] **Update CHANGELOG.md**: *(All feature entries present)*

### 7. Sanitization Checklist

Before creating PR, verify no sensitive data is included.

- [x] **Check for secrets**: *(No secrets in code)*

- [x] **Check for personal paths**: *(Only expected paths in bin/ingest/)*

- [x] **Check for hardcoded usernames**: *(None found)*

- [x] **Verify config externalized**:
  - [x] Secrets in `.env` files (not committed)
  - [x] No hardcoded credentials in source

### 8. Create File Inventory

- [x] **List files for PR** in `.maestro/outputs/FILE_INVENTORY.md`: *(Complete with all 16 features)*

### 9. Prepare for Next Feature

- [x] **Check if more features pending**: *(No features remain - ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)*

## Output

- Feature marked complete in database
- `CHANGELOG.md` updated with feature entry
- `.maestro/outputs/FILE_INVENTORY.md` with PR file list
- `.maestro/outputs/COMPLETION.md` summary

## Post-Completion

When ready to release:
```bash
# Stage changes
git add <specific files>

# Create commit
git commit -m "feat: [feature description]

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create --title "[title]" --body "..."
```

## Optional: Self-Review with PR_Review Playbook

After creating the PR, optionally run the **PR_Review** playbook for self-review.

## Feature Loop: Initialize Next Feature

After completing a feature, the playbook MUST check for and initialize the next feature.

### 10. Clear Current Feature State

- [x] **Archive completed feature context**: *(16 features archived in COMPLETED_FEATURES/)*

### 11. Check for Next Feature

- [x] **List remaining pending features (by ID order)**: *(No pending features remain)*

  **Result: ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE**
  - `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` contains `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE`
  - Playbook exits successfully

### 12. Initialize Next Feature

- [x] **N/A - No next feature**: *(All 16 features complete)*

### 13. Reset Playbook for Next Feature

- [x] **N/A - Playbook complete**: *(No further features to process)*

## PLAYBOOK COMPLETE

**Final Status:** All 16 features implemented and verified.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Features Complete | 16/16 |
| Tests Passing | 460 |
| Expect Calls | 1402 |
| Completion Date | 2026-01-24 |

## Loop Control

After completing Tasks 10-13, the playbook loops back to **Step 0 (SELECT_FEATURE)** to begin the next feature cycle.

**Loop continues until:**
- All features are complete (`specflow list --status pending` returns empty)
- Max loops reached (configurable in Maestro)
- Manual stop by user

---

## Playbook Complete (Final Exit)

The playbook only exits when `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` contains `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE`.

At that point:
1. All features have been implemented
2. PR_Review playbook can be run for final review
3. Session ends
