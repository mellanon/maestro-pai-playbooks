# Step 2: PLAN - Create Technical Architecture

**Phase**: Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Create a technical architecture plan including data models, failure modes, and design decisions.

## Prerequisites

- Specification approved (spec.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "specify"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify spec exists**: ✅ N/A - ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `① specify`

  **Result:** All 16 features complete (15 implemented, 1 skipped). No features require planning.

### 2. Create Technical Plan

- [x] **Run the plan phase**: ✅ N/A - ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE
  ```bash
  specflow plan <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow plan F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  └── plan.md      ← Architecture decisions
  ```

  **Result:** No features in specify phase. All features already at implement/complete.

### 3. Validate Plan Quality

- [x] **Check plan covers**: ✅ N/A - ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE

| Section | Included? |
|---------|-----------|
| Data models | N/A |
| API/Interface design | N/A |
| Error handling strategy | N/A |
| Failure modes | N/A |
| Dependencies | N/A |
| Testing strategy | N/A |

- [x] **Check design against PAI principles**: ✅ N/A - ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE

| Principle | Applied? |
|-----------|----------|
| Code before prompts | N/A |
| Deterministic where possible | N/A |
| CLI-first interfaces | N/A |

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**: ✅ ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE (15/15 implemented, 1 skipped)
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `② plan`

  **Result:** Playbook finished - `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` shows ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/plan.md` with technical architecture
- Feature phase updated to "plan"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 3 (TASKS) to break down implementation units.

## Completion Notes - Loop 10

**Status:** ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE
**Date:** 2026-01-24T19:17:00-08:00

This PLAN phase document was queued during playbook execution but the project has already completed all features. The `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` file contains `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE`, indicating the playbook has finished.

**Final Statistics:**
- 16 total features
- 15 completed
- 1 skipped (F-12 Vector Configuration)
- 394 tests passing

All tasks marked as complete (N/A) since no planning work remains.
