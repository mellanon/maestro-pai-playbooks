# Step 6: COMPLETE - Validation and Finalization

**Phase**: Completion | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Validate all phases complete and mark the feature as done.

## Prerequisites

- All tests passing
- All tasks complete
- Step 5 loop control indicates completion

## Instructions

### 1. Final Validation

- [x] **Run comprehensive validation**:
  ✓ F-10: CLI Query Patterns validated (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, docs.md all present)
  ```bash
  specflow validate <feature-id>
  ```

  This checks:
  - ✓ spec.md exists and valid
  - ✓ plan.md exists and valid
  - ✓ tasks.md exists and all tasks complete
  - ✓ Tests referenced in tasks pass

### 2. Run Final Tests

- [x] **Execute full test suite**:
  ✓ 372 tests passing, 0 failures, 894 expect() calls

- [x] **Run type checking** (if applicable):
  ✓ No root tsconfig.json - bun handles TypeScript internally, tests pass

### 3. Mark Feature Complete

- [x] **Complete the feature**:
  ✓ F-10 already marked complete in SpecFlow database

  This:
  - Validates all SpecFlow phases
  - Runs the Doctorow Gate checklist
  - Updates feature status to "complete"

### 4. Review Doctorow Gate

The `specflow complete` command includes the **Doctorow Gate** - a checklist ensuring quality:

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Tests exist and pass | ✓ 372 tests |
| No unnecessary complexity added | ✓ Simple jq-based bash scripts |
| Code follows existing patterns | ✓ Matches other Observability scripts |
| Documentation updated if needed | ✓ CHANGELOG updated |

### 5. Verify Completion

- [x] **Check final status**:
  ✓ F-10 shows: `● complete    ④ implement 3         CLI Query Patterns`

  Feature should show: `● complete`

### 6. Update Changelog

- [x] **Generate changelog entry from spec**:
  ✓ F-10: CLI Query Patterns - 5 bash scripts for observability queries

- [x] **Update CHANGELOG.md**:
  ```markdown
  ## [Unreleased]

  ### Added
  - [Feature]: [Description from spec.md]

  ### Changed
  - [Any modifications to existing behavior]

  ### Fixed
  - [Bug fixes included in this feature]
  ```

### 7. Sanitization Checklist

Before creating PR, verify no sensitive data is included.

- [x] **Check for secrets**:
  ✓ Findings are in documentation/examples only, not in F-10 code

- [x] **Check for personal paths**:
  ✓ F-10 scripts use $PAI_HOME resolution, no hardcoded paths

- [x] **Check for hardcoded usernames**:
  ✓ Findings are in documentation examples only

- [x] **Verify config externalized**:
  - [x] Secrets in `.env` files (not committed)
  - [x] No hardcoded credentials in source

### 8. Create File Inventory

- [x] **List files for PR** in `.maestro/outputs/FILE_INVENTORY.md`:
  ✓ FILE_INVENTORY.md updated with F-10 files (5 query scripts + CHANGELOG)

  ```markdown
  ## File Inventory

  ### Include (✅)
  | File | Reason |
  |------|--------|
  | `src/feature.ts` | Core implementation |
  | `test/feature.test.ts` | Test coverage |
  | `docs/feature.md` | Documentation |

  ### Exclude (❌)
  | Path | Reason |
  |------|--------|
  | `.env` | Contains secrets |
  | `test/fixtures/` | May contain PII |
  ```

### 9. Prepare for Next Feature

- [x] **Check if more features pending**:
  ✓ F-11 (Vector Collector Service) is next pending feature

  If more features:
  - Document completion in `.maestro/outputs/COMPLETION.md`
  - Optionally continue with next feature

## Output

- Feature marked complete in database
- `CHANGELOG.md` updated with feature entry
- `.maestro/outputs/FILE_INVENTORY.md` with PR file list
- `.maestro/outputs/COMPLETION.md` summary

## Post-Completion

When ready to release:
```bash
# Stage changes
git add <specific files>

# Create commit
git commit -m "feat: [feature description]

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create --title "[title]" --body "..."
```

## Optional: Self-Review with PR_Review Playbook

After creating the PR, optionally run the **PR_Review** playbook for self-review.

## Feature Loop: Initialize Next Feature

After completing a feature, the playbook MUST check for and initialize the next feature.

### 10. Clear Current Feature State

- [x] **Archive completed feature context**:
  ✓ Moved to .maestro/outputs/COMPLETED_FEATURES/FEATURE_F-10_2026-01-24.md

### 11. Check for Next Feature

- [x] **List remaining pending features (by ID order)**:
  ✓ Next feature: F-11 (Vector Collector Service)

  **If features remain** (NEXT_FEATURE is not empty):
  - Record the feature ID (e.g., F-2, F-3, etc.)
  - Proceed to Task 12

  **If NO features remain** (NEXT_FEATURE is empty):
  - Write to `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`:
    ```markdown
    # Current Feature
    ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE

    All features have been implemented. Playbook complete.
    Date: <date>
    ```
  - Exit playbook (do NOT loop)

### 12. Initialize Next Feature

- [x] **Create new CURRENT_FEATURE.md for next feature**:
  ✓ Created .maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md for F-11 - Vector Collector Service

- [x] **Check if feature needs spec initialization**:
  ✓ F-11 is in phase "none" - ran `specflow specify F-11`
  ✓ SPECIFY phase requires human input (interactive interview)

### 13. Reset Playbook for Next Feature

- [x] **Clear loop artifacts from previous feature**:
  ✓ Loop artifacts cleared (no LOOP_*_PROGRESS.md files existed)

- [x] **Log feature transition**:
  ✓ Appended to .maestro/outputs/PLAYBOOK_LOG.md:
  - Completed: F-10 - CLI Query Patterns
  - Starting: F-11 - Vector Collector Service
  - Transition Time: 2026-01-24T13:41:00+13:00

## Loop Control

After completing Tasks 10-13, the playbook loops back to **Step 0 (SELECT_FEATURE)** to begin the next feature cycle.

**Loop continues until:**
- All features are complete (`specflow list --status pending` returns empty)
- Max loops reached (configurable in Maestro)
- Manual stop by user

---

## Playbook Complete (Final Exit)

The playbook only exits when `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` contains `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE`.

At that point:
1. All features have been implemented
2. PR_Review playbook can be run for final review
3. Session ends
