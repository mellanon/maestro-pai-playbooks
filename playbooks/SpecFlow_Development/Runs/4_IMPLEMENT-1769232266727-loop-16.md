# Step 4: IMPLEMENT - TDD Execution

**Phase**: Implementation | **Loop**: Repeats until all tasks complete

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Implement the next task using TDD (Test-Driven Development).

## Prerequisites

- Tasks approved (tasks.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "tasks" or "implement"
- **State directory exists** (create if needed):
  ```bash
  mkdir -p .maestro/outputs
  ```

## Instructions

### 1. Get Implementation Context

- [x] **Get next task context** (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE: 16/16 features at 100%):
  ```bash
  specflow implement
  ```

  Or for a specific feature:
  ```bash
  specflow implement --feature <feature-id>
  ```

  This outputs:
  - Feature spec
  - Technical plan
  - Tasks with current progress
  - Implementation prompt for AI

### 2. TDD Cycle: RED

- [x] **Write failing test first**: ✅ N/A - ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE (16/16 at 100%)
  - Create test file if doesn't exist
  - Write test for the current task's acceptance criteria
  - Run tests to confirm failure (RED state)

- [x] **Record test creation** in `.maestro/outputs/LOOP_PROGRESS.md`: ✅ N/A - No pending tasks
  ```markdown
  ## Task: [task name]
  ### Tests Written
  * test_xxx: [description]
  ```

### 3. TDD Cycle: GREEN

- [x] **Implement minimal code** to make tests pass: ✅ N/A - ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE
  - Focus only on current task
  - Don't over-engineer
  - Follow the plan.md architecture

- [x] **Run tests** to confirm passing (GREEN state): ✅ N/A - No implementation needed
  ```bash
  bun test
  # or project-specific test command
  ```

### 4. TDD Cycle: REFACTOR (if needed)

- [x] **Clean up code** while keeping tests green: ✅ N/A - No code changes made
  - Remove duplication
  - Improve naming
  - Keep it simple

### 5. Update Progress

- [x] **Update progress file**: ✅ Playbook complete - all 16 features implemented
  ```markdown
  ### Implementation
  - Files created: [list]
  - Files modified: [list]
  - Tests passing: [count]
  ```

## Output

- New/modified source files
- New/modified test files
- `.maestro/outputs/LOOP_PROGRESS.md` updated

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 5 (VERIFY) to check progress and loop control
