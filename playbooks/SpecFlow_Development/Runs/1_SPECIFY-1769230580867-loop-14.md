# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  > ✅ **Loop 14 Result:** SpecFlow is initialized and shows 100% completion (16/16 features complete).

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.

  > ✅ **Loop 14 Result:** N/A - Already initialized. All features complete.

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles

  > ✅ **Loop 14 Result:** N/A - No new features to specify. All work complete.

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  > ✅ **Loop 14 Result:** Status shows 16/16 features complete (100%).

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)

  > ✅ **Loop 14 Result:** CURRENT_FEATURE.md contains `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE`. No pending features.

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```

  > ✅ **Loop 14 Result:** N/A - No features to specify. All 16 features have been fully implemented.

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ All features have passing tests |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ Verified |
| No ambiguity | ✅ Verified |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ Verified |

  > ✅ **Loop 14 Result:** N/A - All features complete with 460 tests passing.

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | ✅ | ✅ |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | ✅ | ✅ |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | ✅ | ✅ |

  > ✅ **Loop 14 Result:** N/A - All features complete and validated in previous loops.

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```

  > ✅ **Loop 14 Result:** All 16 features show status "complete" at phase "implement".

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**

  > ✅ **Loop 14 Result:** All features have completed the full pipeline (specify → plan → tasks → implement). Nothing remains in specify phase.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

## ⚠️ Loop 14 Final Status

**ALL FEATURES COMPLETE** - The SpecFlow Development playbook has finished:

- 16/16 features implemented
- 460 tests passing (1402 expect() calls)
- 15 test files
- `.maestro/outputs/COMPLETION.md` documents full results
- `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` confirms `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE`

**This SPECIFY step has no remaining work. The playbook is done.**

## Next

→ ~~Proceed to Step 2 (PLAN) to create technical architecture.~~

→ **PLAYBOOK COMPLETE.** Create PR for `feature/signal-agent-2` branch.
