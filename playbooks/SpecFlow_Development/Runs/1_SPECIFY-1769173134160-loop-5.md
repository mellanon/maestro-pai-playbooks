# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ SpecFlow initialized with 15 features, 3 complete (F-1, F-2, F-3), 12 pending

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ✅ Already initialized - skipped

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Note: File does not exist in this project
  ✅ Reviewed existing spec patterns from F-1, F-2, F-3 to understand project conventions

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ 15 features | 3 complete | 0 in progress | 12 pending | 0 skipped

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  ✅ F-4 PII Scrubbing identified as next feature (priority 3, after completed F-3)

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify F-4
  ```
  ✅ Created comprehensive spec.md at `.specify/specs/f-4-pii-scrubbing/spec.md`

  Spec includes:
  - 5 user scenarios with acceptance criteria
  - 7 functional requirements (FR-1 through FR-7)
  - 14 default secret patterns (Anthropic, OpenAI, AWS, GitHub, JWT, etc.)
  - Performance, reliability, and security requirements
  - Dependencies (F-1, F-2) and success criteria
  - Out of scope items clearly defined

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ Each FR has explicit validation tests defined |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ Each FR focuses on single responsibility |
| No ambiguity | ✅ Regex patterns, formats, and thresholds explicitly specified |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ Depends on F-1 (types) and F-2 (logEvent integration) |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | Yes | ✅ Pure function (sanitizeEvent), same input → same output |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | No | N/A - Library function, not CLI |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | Yes | ✅ Single purpose: sanitize events, nothing else |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="F-4")'
  ```
  ✅ Phase updated from "none" → "specify"

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  ✅ Confirmed via `specflow phase F-4 specify`

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present spec to human for review before proceeding.

Show:
1. `spec.md` requirements
2. Feature description and rationale

**Only proceed to Step 2 after human approval.**
