# Step 2: PLAN - Create Technical Architecture

**Phase**: Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Create a technical architecture plan including data models, failure modes, and design decisions.

## Prerequisites

- Specification approved (spec.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "specify"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify spec exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `① specify`

  ✅ **Verified:** F-017 was in phase `① specify` before running plan command.

### 2. Create Technical Plan

- [x] **Run the plan phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow plan <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow plan F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  └── plan.md      ← Architecture decisions
  ```

  ✅ **Completed:** Ran `specflow plan F-017`. Created comprehensive technical plan at `.specify/specs/f-017-otlp-hook-instrumentation/plan.md`.

### 3. Validate Plan Quality

- [x] **Check plan covers**:

| Section | Included? |
|---------|-----------|
| Data models | ✅ Yes - "Data Model" section with PAIEvent schema extension (trace_id, span_id, parent_span_id) and SpanContext type definitions |
| API/Interface design | ✅ Yes - "API Contracts" section with VictoriaTraces OTLP ingestion endpoint and Grafana trace query APIs |
| Error handling strategy | ✅ Yes - `safe.ts` graceful degradation wrapper with try/catch and fallback to non-traced execution |
| Failure modes | ✅ Yes - "Risk Assessment" table with 7 identified risks (OTLP incompatibility, premature exit, SDK slowness, env propagation, Bun compat, missing settings, Grafana issues) |
| Dependencies | ✅ Yes - "Dependencies" section with OpenTelemetry packages, external services (VictoriaTraces, Grafana, Vector), and feature dependencies (F-1, F-2, F-5-9, F-15) |
| Testing strategy | ✅ Yes - "Phase 8: Tests and Validation" with specific test files listed (tracer.test.ts, safe.test.ts, hook test updates, integration tests) |

- [x] **Check design against PAI principles**:

| Principle | Applied? |
|-----------|----------|
| Code before prompts | ✅ Yes - All implementations are TypeScript code with explicit types; no prompt-based configuration |
| Deterministic where possible | ✅ Yes - Lazy initialization pattern, config-driven enable/disable, explicit environment variables for context propagation |
| CLI-first interfaces | ✅ Yes - Configuration via settings.json, environment variable overrides (OTEL_*), integrates with existing CLI query tools via trace_id correlation |

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `② plan`

  ✅ **Verified:** F-017 now shows phase `② plan` in specflow status output.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/plan.md` with technical architecture
- Feature phase updated to "plan"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 3 (TASKS) to break down implementation units.
