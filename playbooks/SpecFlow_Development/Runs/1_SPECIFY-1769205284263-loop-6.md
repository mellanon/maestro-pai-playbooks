# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ Already initialized with 16 features, 11 complete, 5 pending

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  N/A - Project already initialized

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Not present in worktree, using embedded principles from spec

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ 69% complete (11/16 features)

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  ✅ F-016: Skill Invocation Enforcement (Priority 2, next pending after completed F-10)

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ✅ Created comprehensive spec at `.specify/specs/f-016-skill-invocation-enforcement/spec.md`

  Feature enriched with metadata for batch mode:
  - problemType: scattered
  - urgency: blocking_work
  - primaryUser: developers
  - integrationScope: extends_existing

  Spec includes:
  - 3 user scenarios (with/without extensions, disabled)
  - 5 functional requirements (FR-1 to FR-5)
  - 3 non-functional requirements (NFR-1 to NFR-3)
  - Full code implementation examples
  - Test strategy with 7 unit tests and 5 integration tests
  - 4 design decisions documented

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ Each FR has acceptance criteria |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ Single-purpose requirements |
| No ambiguity | ✅ Code examples provided |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ F-1, F-2, F-7 in frontmatter |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | ✅ | ✅ Hook behavior is deterministic |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | N/A | N/A (hook, not CLI) |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | ✅ | ✅ Single purpose: enforce extension loading |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow phase F-016 specify
  ```
  ✅ Phase set to "specify"

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  ✅ Confirmed

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database
