# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  **Result:** SpecFlow already initialized with 15 features (4 complete, 11 pending). `.maestro/` directory exists.

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```
  **Result:** N/A - Already initialized.

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles
  **Result:** Read PAI-PRINCIPLES.md (16 principles) and TDD-EVALS.md from `/Users/andreas/Developer/maestro-pai-playbooks/docs/`.

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  **Result:** F-5 (SessionStart Hook Instrumentation) identified as next feature from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`.

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  **Result:** F-5 - SessionStart Hook Instrumentation (Priority 3, depends on F-1, F-2)

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```
  **Result:** Created comprehensive spec manually at `.specify/specs/f-5-sessionstart-hook-instrumentation/spec.md` following the F-4 pattern. Specflow interactive mode was not suitable for autonomous execution, so spec was authored directly using the established patterns from F-1 through F-4 specs.

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements (CREATED)
  ```

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✓ Each success criterion maps to a verifiable test |
| Requirements are atomic | ✓ Single event, single hook, clear boundaries |
| No ambiguity | ✓ Code examples show exact implementation |
| Dependencies identified | ✓ F-1, F-2 clearly stated as upstream |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | ✓ | ✓ Pure TypeScript, no LLM calls |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | N/A | Event logging, not CLI |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | ✓ | ✓ Single purpose: emit one event type |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="F-5")'
  ```
  **Result:**
  ```json
  {
    "id": "F-5",
    "name": "SessionStart Hook Instrumentation",
    "phase": "specify",
    "status": "pending",
    "priority": 3
  }
  ```

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  **Result:** Phase transitioned from "none" to "specify" via `specflow phase F-5 specify`.

## Output

- `.specify/specs/f-5-sessionstart-hook-instrumentation/spec.md` with detailed requirements ✓
- Feature status updated in database ✓

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present spec to human for review before proceeding.

Show:
1. `spec.md` requirements - Available at `.specify/specs/f-5-sessionstart-hook-instrumentation/spec.md`
2. Feature description and rationale - SessionStart Hook Instrumentation captures session.start events with model, working_dir, and session_id metadata for observability

**Spec includes:**
- 4 user scenarios with acceptance criteria
- 5 functional requirements with code examples
- 4 non-functional requirements
- Constitutional gate validation (PAI-PRINCIPLES + TDD-EVALS)
- Test strategy with unit, integration, and verification tests
- Design decisions documented

**Only proceed to Step 2 after human approval.**
