# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  > ✅ **COMPLETE (Loop 20)**: SpecFlow is initialized with all 16 features at 100% completion.
  > All features are in status "complete" at phase "implement". No pending work remains.

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.

  > ✅ **N/A (Loop 20)**: Already initialized - no action needed.

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles

  > ✅ **N/A (Loop 20)**: All features complete - no new specifications needed.

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  > ✅ **COMPLETE (Loop 20)**: 16 features, all at 100% completion in implement phase.

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)

  > ✅ **COMPLETE (Loop 20)**: CURRENT_FEATURE.md shows ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE. No pending features.

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```

  > ✅ **N/A (Loop 20)**: No features require specification - all 16 complete.

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | N/A - All complete |
| Requirements are atomic | N/A - All complete |
| No ambiguity | N/A - All complete |
| Dependencies identified | N/A - All complete |

  > ✅ **N/A (Loop 20)**: All specifications validated in prior loops.

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | N/A | All complete |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | N/A | All complete |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | N/A | All complete |

  > ✅ **N/A (Loop 20)**: All designs validated in prior loops.

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```

  > ✅ **COMPLETE (Loop 20)**: All 16 features verified complete at implement phase.

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**

  > ✅ **COMPLETE (Loop 20)**: All features have progressed through specify → plan → tasks → implement. Playbook 100% complete.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 2 (PLAN) to create technical architecture.
