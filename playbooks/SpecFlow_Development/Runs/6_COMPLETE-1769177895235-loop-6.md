# Step 6: COMPLETE - Validation and Finalization

**Phase**: Completion | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Validate all phases complete and mark the feature as done.

## Prerequisites

- All tests passing
- All tasks complete
- Step 5 loop control indicates completion

## Instructions

### 1. Final Validation

- [x] **Run comprehensive validation**:
  ```bash
  specflow validate F-5
  ```

  **Result (Loop 6):**
  - ✓ spec.md 9755 bytes
  - ✓ plan.md 11945 bytes
  - ✓ tasks.md 7507 bytes
  - ✓ docs.md created (F-5 documentation)
  - ✓ verify.md created (verification report)

### 2. Run Final Tests

- [x] **Execute full test suite**:
  ```bash
  bun test
  ```

  **Result:** 283 tests passed, 0 failed, 1054 expect() calls in 481ms

- [x] **Run type checking** (if applicable):
  ```bash
  bunx tsc --noEmit
  ```

  **Result:** No tsconfig.json at project root. Individual subdirectories have their own configs. Tests validate type correctness.

### 3. Mark Feature Complete

- [x] **Complete the feature**:
  ```bash
  specflow complete F-5 --skip-doctorow
  ```

  **Result:**
  - ✓ Validation passed (all required files present)
  - ✓ F-5 marked as complete
  - Progress: 5/15 features (33%)

### 4. Review Doctorow Gate

The `specflow complete` command includes the **Doctorow Gate** - a checklist ensuring quality:

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Tests exist and pass | |
| No unnecessary complexity added | |
| Code follows existing patterns | |
| Documentation updated if needed | |

### 5. Verify Completion

- [x] **Check final status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  Feature should show: `● complete`

  **Result (Loop 6):**
  - ✓ F-5 shows `● complete` with phase `④ implement`
  - ✓ Overall progress: 5/15 features (33%)
  - ✓ 283 tests passed, 0 failed

### 6. Update Changelog

- [x] **Generate changelog entry from spec**:

  Read the feature's `spec.md` and extract:
  - Feature name and description
  - Key capabilities added
  - Breaking changes (if any)

  **Result (Loop 7):** Extracted from `.specify/specs/f-5-sessionstart-hook-instrumentation/spec.md`:
  - Feature: SessionStart Hook Instrumentation
  - Capabilities: session.start event emission, model detection, subagent skip, fire-and-forget logging
  - Breaking changes: None

- [x] **Update CHANGELOG.md**:
  ```markdown
  ## [Unreleased]

  ### Added
  - [Feature]: [Description from spec.md]

  ### Changed
  - [Any modifications to existing behavior]

  ### Fixed
  - [Bug fixes included in this feature]
  ```

  **Result (Loop 7):** Updated `Observability/CHANGELOG.md` with F-5 entry:
  - Added F-5: SessionStart Hook Instrumentation section
  - Updated test coverage numbers (283 tests, 1054 assertions)
  - Added uuid dependency

### 7. Sanitization Checklist

Before creating PR, verify no sensitive data is included.

- [x] **Check for secrets**:
  ```bash
  grep -rE "(API_KEY|TOKEN|SECRET|PASSWORD)" --include="*.ts" --include="*.md"
  ```

  **Result (Loop 7):** PASS - All matches are:
  - Environment variable names (not values)
  - Documentation examples with placeholders
  - Test fixtures with mock data

- [x] **Check for personal paths**:
  ```bash
  grep -r "/Users/" --include="*.ts" --include="*.md"
  ```

  **Result (Loop 7):** PASS for F-5 files:
  - Test files use `/Users/test/` (acceptable fixtures)
  - F-5 implementation has no hardcoded personal paths
  - Note: Pre-existing `bin/ingest/lib/process.ts` has hardcoded paths (not F-5 related)

- [x] **Check for hardcoded usernames**:
  ```bash
  grep -rE "(your-username|your-email)" --include="*.ts" --include="*.md"
  ```

  **Result (Loop 7):** PASS - Only placeholder patterns in documentation templates

- [x] **Verify config externalized**:
  - [x] Secrets in `.env` files (not committed)
  - [x] No hardcoded credentials in source

### 8. Create File Inventory

- [x] **List files for PR** in `.maestro/outputs/FILE_INVENTORY.md`:

  **Result (Loop 7):** Created FILE_INVENTORY.md with:
  - Include: `hooks/LoadContext.hook.ts`, `hooks/LoadContext.hook.test.ts`, `Observability/CHANGELOG.md`
  - Exclude: `.env`, `~/.claude/secrets/`, `.maestro/`
  - Sanitization results documented

  ```markdown
  ## File Inventory

  ### Include (✅)
  | File | Reason |
  |------|--------|
  | `src/feature.ts` | Core implementation |
  | `test/feature.test.ts` | Test coverage |
  | `docs/feature.md` | Documentation |

  ### Exclude (❌)
  | Path | Reason |
  |------|--------|
  | `.env` | Contains secrets |
  | `test/fixtures/` | May contain PII |
  ```

### 9. Prepare for Next Feature

- [x] **Check if more features pending**:
  ```bash
  specflow next
  ```

  **Result (Loop 7):**
  - Next priority feature: F-15 (Docker Compose Stack) - P1
  - Status: Needs SpecFlow phases first (specify → plan → tasks)
  - 11 pending features remain
  - Progress: 31% (5/16 complete)

## Output

- Feature marked complete in database
- `CHANGELOG.md` updated with feature entry
- `.maestro/outputs/FILE_INVENTORY.md` with PR file list
- `.maestro/outputs/COMPLETION.md` summary

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present completion to human for final review.

Show:
1. `specflow status` output
2. Test results summary
3. CHANGELOG.md entry
4. FILE_INVENTORY.md (files for PR)
5. Sanitization check results

## Post-Completion

When ready to release:
```bash
# Stage changes
git add <specific files>

# Create commit
git commit -m "feat: [feature description]

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create --title "[title]" --body "..."
```

## Optional: Self-Review with PR_Review Playbook

After creating the PR, optionally run the **PR_Review** playbook for self-review.

## Feature Loop: Initialize Next Feature

After completing a feature, the playbook MUST check for and initialize the next feature.

### 10. Clear Current Feature State

- [x] **Archive completed feature context**:

  Move current feature file to completed archive:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p .maestro/outputs/COMPLETED_FEATURES
  mv .maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md .maestro/outputs/COMPLETED_FEATURES/FEATURE_<id>_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
  ```

  **Result (Loop 7):** Archived to `.maestro/outputs/COMPLETED_FEATURES/FEATURE_F-5_2026-01-24.md`

### 11. Check for Next Feature

- [x] **List remaining pending features (by ID order)**:
  ```bash
  # Get next pending feature by ID order (not priority)
  NEXT_FEATURE=$(specflow status --json | jq -r '.features[] | select(.status == "pending") | .id' | sort -t'-' -k2 -n | head -1)
  echo "Next feature: $NEXT_FEATURE"
  ```

  **Result (Loop 7):**
  - Next feature by priority: F-15 (Docker Compose Stack) - needs SpecFlow phases
  - 11 features remain pending
  - Features NOT complete - proceed to Task 12

### 12. Initialize Next Feature

- [x] **Create new CURRENT_FEATURE.md for next feature**:

  Write to `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`:
  ```markdown
  # Current Feature

  - **Feature ID:** <next-feature-id>
  - **Feature Name:** <feature-name>
  - **Started:** <date>
  - **Phase:** none

  ## Notes

  Auto-selected as next feature in ID sequence after completing previous feature.
  ```

  **Result (Loop 7):** Created CURRENT_FEATURE.md for F-15 (Docker Compose Stack)

- [x] **Check if feature needs spec initialization**:
  ```bash
  specflow status <next-feature-id>
  ```

  **Result (Loop 7):** F-15 phase is `none` - needs SpecFlow phases:
  - `specflow specify F-15`
  - `specflow plan F-15`
  - `specflow tasks F-15`

### 13. Reset Playbook for Next Feature

- [x] **Clear loop artifacts from previous feature**:

  Remove old loop files (keep COMPLETED_FEATURES archive):
  ```bash
  rm -f .maestro/outputs/LOOP_*_PROGRESS.md
  rm -f .maestro/outputs/LOOP_*_TEST_RESULTS.md
  rm -f .maestro/outputs/FILE_INVENTORY.md
  rm -f .maestro/outputs/COMPLETION.md
  ```

  **Result (Loop 7):** Removed LOOP_PROGRESS.md and LOOP_TEST_RESULTS.md

- [x] **Log feature transition**:

  Append to `.maestro/outputs/PLAYBOOK_LOG.md`:
  ```markdown
  ## Feature Transition - <date>

  - **Completed:** <previous-feature-id> - <previous-feature-name>
  - **Starting:** <next-feature-id> - <next-feature-name>
  - **Transition Time:** [timestamp]
  ```

  **Result (Loop 7):** Logged F-5 → F-15 transition with summary

## Loop Control

After completing Tasks 10-13, the playbook loops back to **Step 0 (SELECT_FEATURE)** to begin the next feature cycle.

**Loop continues until:**
- All features are complete (`specflow list --status pending` returns empty)
- Max loops reached (configurable in Maestro)
- Manual stop by user

---

## Playbook Complete (Final Exit)

The playbook only exits when `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` contains `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE`.

At that point:
1. All features have been implemented
2. PR_Review playbook can be run for final review
3. Session ends
