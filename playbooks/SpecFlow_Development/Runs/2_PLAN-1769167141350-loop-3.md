# Step 2: PLAN - Create Technical Architecture

**Phase**: Planning | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Create a technical architecture plan including data models, failure modes, and design decisions.

## Prerequisites

- Specification approved (spec.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "specify"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify spec exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `① specify`

  **Note (Loop 3):** F-3 is already at phase `③ tasks` - plan phase completed in earlier iterations. spec.md and plan.md both exist at `.specify/specs/f-3-concurrent-write-handling/`.

### 2. Create Technical Plan

- [x] **Run the plan phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow plan <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow plan F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  └── plan.md      ← Architecture decisions
  ```

  **Note (Loop 3):** Plan already exists at `.specify/specs/f-3-concurrent-write-handling/plan.md`. Comprehensive technical architecture with lock module, merge utility, file structure, API contracts, and failure modes.

### 3. Validate Plan Quality

- [x] **Check plan covers**:

| Section | Included? |
|---------|-----------|
| Data models | ✅ LockContent interface, LockResult type, file system structure |
| API/Interface design | ✅ acquireLock, releaseLock, mergeAgentFiles, getAgentFiles APIs |
| Error handling strategy | ✅ Fire-and-forget for logEvent, throws for merge failures |
| Failure modes | ✅ Comprehensive table: crashed process, timeout, race conditions, disk full |
| Dependencies | ✅ Upstream (F-1, F-2, Node fs) and downstream (hooks, CLI, dashboards) |
| Testing strategy | ✅ Unit tests for lock/merge, stress tests for concurrency, benchmarks |

- [x] **Check design against PAI principles**:

| Principle | Applied? |
|-----------|----------|
| Code before prompts | ✅ All TypeScript implementation, no AI inference |
| Deterministic where possible | ✅ Synchronous fs ops, atomic wx flag, predictable fallback |
| CLI-first interfaces | ✅ Functions callable from CLI, mergeAgentFiles for maintenance |

  **Note (Loop 3):** Plan validated - all sections present with detailed implementation guidance.

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `② plan`

  **Note (Loop 3):** F-3 is at phase `③ tasks` which is BEYOND the plan phase. The plan was completed and approved in a previous iteration, and the feature has already progressed to the tasks phase with 10 implementation tasks defined.

  Current status from `specflow status`:
  - F-3: pending, phase ③ tasks, priority 3, "Concurrent Write Handling"
  - T-1.1 already completed (2026-01-23)
  - 9 remaining implementation tasks

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/plan.md` with technical architecture
- Feature phase updated to "plan"

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present plan to human for review before proceeding.

Show:
1. `plan.md` architecture decisions
2. Data models and interfaces
3. Failure modes and mitigations

**Only proceed to Step 3 after human approval.**
