# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

  **Note:** F-13 is already at phase ④ implement (status: in_progress). The TASKS phase was completed in a previous loop iteration. All tasks T-1.1 through T-4.1 are marked complete in tasks.md.

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

  **Note:** tasks.md already exists at `.specify/specs/f-13-vector-health-watchdog/tasks.md` with comprehensive task breakdown (T-1.1 through T-4.2).

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`):

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | ✅ Each task has explicit acceptance criteria |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | ✅ All tasks have "Acceptance:" sections |
| Dependencies are explicit | ✅ Dependencies listed per task (e.g., "Dependencies: T-1.1") |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | ✅ Execution Order section documents phase dependencies |

- [x] **Check task granularity**:
  - [x] No task is too large (can be done in one session) - ✅ Tasks are focused single-function implementations
  - [x] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped) - ✅ Related functionality grouped (e.g., T-1.2 health checks, T-2.3 notifications)
  - [x] Each task has a verifiable outcome - ✅ All tasks have specific acceptance criteria

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `③ tasks`

  **Note:** F-13 is at phase ④ implement, which confirms the TASKS phase was completed successfully. The feature has progressed beyond the TASKS phase and is now in active implementation with 9/10 tasks complete.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 4 (IMPLEMENT) to begin TDD implementation.
