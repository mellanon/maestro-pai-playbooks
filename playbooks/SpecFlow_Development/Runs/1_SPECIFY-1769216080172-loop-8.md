# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  > ✅ SpecFlow initialized with 16 features (11 complete, 5 pending)

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.
  > ✅ Already initialized - skipped

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles
  > ⚠️ File not present in this project - used inferred principles from existing specs

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  > ✅ Viewed - identified F-11 "Vector Collector Service" as current feature per CURRENT_FEATURE.md

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  > ✅ F-11 identified from CURRENT_FEATURE.md (was marked as needing specification)

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```
  > ✅ Created `.specify/specs/f-11-vector-collector-service/spec.md` with full specification including:
  > - 4 user scenarios with acceptance criteria
  > - 8 functional requirements (Docker service, volume mounts, checkpoints, health checks, etc.)
  > - Non-functional requirements (performance, reliability, security)
  > - Dependencies: F-2 (Event Logging), F-12 (Vector Config), F-15 (Docker Stack)
  > - Success criteria checklist

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ All acceptance criteria have clear pass/fail conditions |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ Each requirement is independently verifiable |
| No ambiguity | ✅ Specific versions (Vector 0.41.0), paths, and behaviors defined |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ F-2, F-12, F-15 clearly listed as upstream |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | ✅ Yes | ✅ Specific version pinning, predictable behavior |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | ✅ Yes | ✅ manage.sh integration included |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Vector does one thing: collect/ship logs |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="F-11")'
  ```
  > ✅ Feature shows phase: "specify"

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  > ✅ Confirmed - F-11 is now in specify phase

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements ✅
- Feature status updated in database ✅
