# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ SpecFlow is initialized with 16 features (10 complete, 6 pending)

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.
  ✅ Already initialized - skipped

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles
  ✅ File does not exist - spec designed following CLI-first, single-purpose principles

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ 16 features | 10 complete | 6 pending | 63% progress

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  ✅ F-10 (CLI Query Patterns) identified as current feature from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```
  ✅ Created `.specify/specs/f-10-cli-query-patterns/spec.md` (15,862 bytes)
  - Defined 5 shell scripts: errors-today.sh, session-duration.sh, api-costs.sh, slow-hooks.sh, skill-usage.sh
  - 5 user scenarios with acceptance criteria
  - 9 functional requirements with jq query implementations
  - Dependencies: F-1 (Event Schema), F-2 (Event Logging Library)

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ Each FR has validation criteria |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ Each script has single purpose |
| No ambiguity | ✅ Exact jq queries specified |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ F-1, F-2 dependencies documented |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | ✅ Yes | ✅ Pure bash+jq, no side effects |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | ✅ Yes | ✅ All scripts are CLI tools |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Each script does one thing |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```
  ✅ Verified: F-10 status is `pending`, phase is `specify`

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  ✅ Phase confirmed via `specflow phase F-10 specify`

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database
