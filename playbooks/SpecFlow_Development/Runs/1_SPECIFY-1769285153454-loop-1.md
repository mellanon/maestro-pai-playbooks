# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  > ✅ SpecFlow initialized: 17 features, 16 complete, 1 pending (F-017)

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.
  > ✅ Already initialized - skipped

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles
  > ⚠️ `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` not found in project. Validated against general PAI principles from project context.

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  > ✅ 17 features total, F-017 "OTLP Hook Instrumentation" is the only pending feature at priority 999

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  > ✅ F-017 "OTLP Hook Instrumentation" - Add OpenTelemetry distributed tracing to PAI hooks

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```
  > ✅ Spec already exists at `.specify/specs/f-017-otlp-hook-instrumentation/spec.md` (374 lines)

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ FR-1 through FR-7 have explicit validation sections with code examples |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ Each FR is self-contained and independently implementable |
| No ambiguity | ✅ TypeScript interfaces, code snippets, and acceptance criteria provided |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ Explicitly lists F-1, F-2, F-5, F-6, F-7, F-8, F-9, F-15 as upstream dependencies |

> ⚠️ `docs/TDD-EVALS.md` not found in project. Validated against standard spec quality criteria.

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | ✅ Yes | ✅ Graceful degradation in FR-6 ensures predictable behavior |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | N/A | Library code, not CLI |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Single purpose: OTel tracing integration |

> ⚠️ `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` not found in project. Validated against PAI founding principles.

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```
  > ✅ F-017 status: pending, phase: specify

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  > ✅ Confirmed: F-017 is in "specify" phase with comprehensive spec at `.specify/specs/f-017-otlp-hook-instrumentation/spec.md`

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database
