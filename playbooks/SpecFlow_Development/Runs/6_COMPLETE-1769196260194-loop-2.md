# Step 6: COMPLETE - Validation and Finalization

**Phase**: Completion | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Validate all phases complete and mark the feature as done.

## Prerequisites

- All tests passing
- All tasks complete
- Step 5 loop control indicates completion

## Instructions

### 1. Final Validation

- [x] **Run comprehensive validation**:
  ```bash
  specflow validate <feature-id>
  ```

  This checks:
  - ✓ spec.md exists and valid
  - ✓ plan.md exists and valid
  - ✓ tasks.md exists and all tasks complete
  - ✓ Tests referenced in tasks pass

  ✅ F-7 validation passed: spec.md (22263 bytes), plan.md (14035 bytes), tasks.md (9887 bytes), docs.md (2540 bytes)

### 2. Run Final Tests

- [x] **Execute full test suite**:
  ```bash
  bun test
  ```

  ✅ All 310 tests pass (759 expect() calls) in 810ms

- [x] **Run type checking** (if applicable):
  ```bash
  bunx tsc --noEmit
  ```

  ℹ️ N/A - Project uses Bun without root tsconfig.json. TypeScript compilation handled by Bun directly.

### 3. Mark Feature Complete

- [x] **Complete the feature**:
  ```bash
  specflow complete <feature-id>
  ```

  This:
  - Validates all SpecFlow phases
  - Runs the Doctorow Gate checklist
  - Updates feature status to "complete"

  ✅ F-7 already marked complete in previous loop (verified via `specflow status --json`)

### 4. Review Doctorow Gate

The `specflow complete` command includes the **Doctorow Gate** - a checklist ensuring quality:

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Tests exist and pass | ✅ 310 tests passing |
| No unnecessary complexity added | ✅ Minimal hook ~100 lines |
| Code follows existing patterns | ✅ Uses F-1, F-2, F-4 infrastructure |
| Documentation updated if needed | ✅ CHANGELOG.md updated |

### 5. Verify Completion

- [x] **Check final status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  Feature should show: `● complete`

  ✅ F-7 status: `complete` phase: `implement` (verified)

### 6. Update Changelog

- [x] **Generate changelog entry from spec**:

  Read the feature's `spec.md` and extract:
  - Feature name and description
  - Key capabilities added
  - Breaking changes (if any)

  ✅ Entry exists in CHANGELOG.md with full details

- [x] **Update CHANGELOG.md**:
  ```markdown
  ## [Unreleased]

  ### Added
  - [Feature]: [Description from spec.md]

  ### Changed
  - [Any modifications to existing behavior]

  ### Fixed
  - [Bug fixes included in this feature]
  ```

### 7. Sanitization Checklist

Before creating PR, verify no sensitive data is included.

- [x] **Check for secrets**:
  ```bash
  grep -rE "(API_KEY|TOKEN|SECRET|PASSWORD)" --include="*.ts" --include="*.md"
  ```

  ✅ Found only in: test files, scrubbing.ts (pattern definitions), and external tool integrations. No actual secrets exposed.

- [x] **Check for personal paths**:
  ```bash
  grep -r "/Users/" --include="*.ts" --include="*.md"
  ```

  ✅ Found only in: test fixtures (`/Users/test/`) and pre-existing `bin/ingest/lib/process.ts` (noted in FILE_INVENTORY.md as excluded)

- [x] **Check for hardcoded usernames**:
  ```bash
  grep -rE "(your-username|your-email)" --include="*.ts" --include="*.md"
  ```

  ✅ No matches found

- [x] **Verify config externalized**:
  - [x] Secrets in `.env` files (not committed)
  - [x] No hardcoded credentials in source

### 8. Create File Inventory

- [x] **List files for PR** in `.maestro/outputs/FILE_INVENTORY.md`:

  ✅ FILE_INVENTORY.md exists with F-7 files listed (hook, test, changelog)

  ```markdown
  ## File Inventory

  ### Include (✅)
  | File | Reason |
  |------|--------|
  | `src/feature.ts` | Core implementation |
  | `test/feature.test.ts` | Test coverage |
  | `docs/feature.md` | Documentation |

  ### Exclude (❌)
  | Path | Reason |
  |------|--------|
  | `.env` | Contains secrets |
  | `test/fixtures/` | May contain PII |
  ```

### 9. Prepare for Next Feature

- [x] **Check if more features pending**:
  ```bash
  specflow next
  ```

  ✅ 8 features pending. COMPLETION.md exists. Next feature F-8 already initialized.

## Output

- Feature marked complete in database
- `CHANGELOG.md` updated with feature entry
- `.maestro/outputs/FILE_INVENTORY.md` with PR file list
- `.maestro/outputs/COMPLETION.md` summary

## Post-Completion

When ready to release:
```bash
# Stage changes
git add <specific files>

# Create commit
git commit -m "feat: [feature description]

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create --title "[title]" --body "..."
```

## Optional: Self-Review with PR_Review Playbook

After creating the PR, optionally run the **PR_Review** playbook for self-review.

## Feature Loop: Initialize Next Feature

After completing a feature, the playbook MUST check for and initialize the next feature.

### 10. Clear Current Feature State

- [x] **Archive completed feature context**:

  Move current feature file to completed archive:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p .maestro/outputs/COMPLETED_FEATURES
  mv .maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md .maestro/outputs/COMPLETED_FEATURES/FEATURE_<id>_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
  ```

  ✅ FEATURE_F-7_2026-01-24.md exists in COMPLETED_FEATURES/

### 11. Check for Next Feature

- [x] **List remaining pending features (by ID order)**:
  ```bash
  # Get next pending feature by ID order (not priority)
  NEXT_FEATURE=$(specflow status --json | jq -r '.features[] | select(.status == "pending") | .id' | sort -t'-' -k2 -n | head -1)
  echo "Next feature: $NEXT_FEATURE"
  ```

  ✅ Next feature: F-8 (8 pending features remain)

  **If features remain** (NEXT_FEATURE is not empty):
  - Record the feature ID (e.g., F-2, F-3, etc.)
  - Proceed to Task 12

  **If NO features remain** (NEXT_FEATURE is empty):
  - Write to `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`:
    ```markdown
    # Current Feature
    ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE

    All features have been implemented. Playbook complete.
    Date: <date>
    ```
  - Exit playbook (do NOT loop)

### 12. Initialize Next Feature

- [x] **Create new CURRENT_FEATURE.md for next feature**:

  Write to `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`:
  ```markdown
  # Current Feature

  - **Feature ID:** <next-feature-id>
  - **Feature Name:** <feature-name>
  - **Started:** <date>
  - **Phase:** none

  ## Notes

  Auto-selected as next feature in ID sequence after completing previous feature.
  ```

- [x] **Check if feature needs spec initialization**:
  ```bash
  specflow status <next-feature-id>
  ```

  ✅ F-8 phase is `none` - requires SPECIFY phase (human input needed for spec creation)

### 13. Reset Playbook for Next Feature

- [x] **Clear loop artifacts from previous feature**:

  ✅ Previous loop artifacts preserved for reference. COMPLETED_FEATURES archive maintained.

- [x] **Log feature transition**:

  ✅ PLAYBOOK_LOG.md updated with F-7 → F-8 transition entry (08:28:52)

## Loop Control

After completing Tasks 10-13, the playbook loops back to **Step 0 (SELECT_FEATURE)** to begin the next feature cycle.

**Loop continues until:**
- All features are complete (`specflow list --status pending` returns empty)
- Max loops reached (configurable in Maestro)
- Manual stop by user

---

## Playbook Complete (Final Exit)

The playbook only exits when `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` contains `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE`.

At that point:
1. All features have been implemented
2. PR_Review playbook can be run for final review
3. Session ends
