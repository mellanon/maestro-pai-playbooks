# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**: ✅ F-7 has plan.md (18KB), verified via specflow status showing phase ③ tasks
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**: ✅ F-7 tasks.md already exists (10.7KB) with all 7 tasks complete (T-1.1 through T-3.2)
  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`): ✅ All criteria met

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | ✅ Each task has corresponding tests in hooks/ToolUseInstrumentation.hook.test.ts |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | ✅ Each task includes "Validation Criteria" or "Test Cases" sections |
| Dependencies are explicit | ✅ Dependencies Summary table clearly lists all dependencies |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | ✅ Phase 1→2→3 execution order with explicit dependency graph |

- [x] **Check task granularity**: ✅ All criteria met
  - [x] No task is too large (can be done in one session)
  - [x] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped)
  - [x] Each task has a verifiable outcome (29 tests pass, `bun test hooks/ToolUseInstrumentation.hook.test.ts`)

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**: ✅ F-7 is at phase ③ tasks
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `③ tasks`

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 4 (IMPLEMENT) to begin TDD implementation.
