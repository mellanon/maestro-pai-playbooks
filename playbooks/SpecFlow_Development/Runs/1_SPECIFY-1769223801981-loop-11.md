# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ SpecFlow is initialized - 16 features total, F-14 is pending

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  N/A - Already initialized with 16 features

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - File does not exist in this project, but PAI founding principles are followed (deterministic code, CLI-first, UNIX philosophy)

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ 14 complete, 2 pending (F-14 and F-016)

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  ✅ F-14: Log Rotation Script - next pending feature

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ✅ Created `.specify/specs/f-14-log-rotation-script/spec.md` with comprehensive specification including:
  - 4 user scenarios with acceptance criteria
  - 7 functional requirements (FR-1 through FR-7)
  - Non-functional requirements for performance, reliability, security
  - Dependencies (upstream: F-2, downstream: CLI queries, VictoriaLogs)
  - 11 success criteria

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ All acceptance criteria are verifiable |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ Each FR addresses single concern |
| No ambiguity | ✅ Specific paths, commands, formats defined |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ F-2 upstream, CLI/VictoriaLogs downstream |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | ✅ Yes | ✅ Date-based file matching, no randomness |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | ✅ Yes | ✅ manage.sh commands for all operations |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Single script for log rotation only |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="F-14")'
  ```
  ✅ F-14 phase is now "specify"

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  ✅ Verified: F-14 phase updated from "none" to "specify"

## Output

- ✅ `.specify/specs/f-14-log-rotation-script/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- ✅ Feature status updated in database
- ✅ `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` updated to reflect specify phase
