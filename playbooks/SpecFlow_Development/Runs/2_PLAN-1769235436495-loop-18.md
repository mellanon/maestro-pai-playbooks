# Step 2: PLAN - Create Technical Architecture

**Phase**: Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Create a technical architecture plan including data models, failure modes, and design decisions.

## Prerequisites

- Specification approved (spec.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "specify"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify spec exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `① specify`

  **Result (Loop 18):** All 16 features are complete at `④ implement` phase. No features in `① specify` phase requiring planning. 16/16 plan.md files exist.

### 2. Create Technical Plan

- [x] **Run the plan phase**: N/A - All features already complete

### 3. Validate Plan Quality

- [x] **Check plan covers**: N/A - All 16 features already have plan.md files and are fully implemented

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**: All 16 features at `④ implement` (complete). No pending work.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/plan.md` with technical architecture
- Feature phase updated to "plan"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 3 (TASKS) to break down implementation units.
