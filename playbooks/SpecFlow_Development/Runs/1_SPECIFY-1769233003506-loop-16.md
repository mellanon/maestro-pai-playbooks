# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:

  **✅ COMPLETE - All 16 features at 100% completion**

  `specflow status` shows:
  - 16 features | 16 complete | 0 in progress | 0 pending
  - Progress: 100%
  - `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` confirms: ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE

  **No further SPECIFY work needed - playbook is complete.**
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:

  **✅ SKIPPED - Project already fully complete. All 16 features at 100%.**
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles

  **✅ SKIPPED - Project already fully complete. All 16 features at 100%. No new specifications needed.**

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:

  **✅ VERIFIED COMPLETE:**
  - `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` confirms: `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE`
  - `.maestro/outputs/COMPLETION.md` confirms: 16/16 features (100%)
  - 460 tests passing, 1402 expect() calls
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)

  **✅ NO NEXT FEATURE - All features completed:**
  - F-1 through F-15: Complete
  - F-016 (Skill Invocation Enforcement): Complete (final feature)

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:

  **✅ SKIPPED - No pending features to specify. Playbook complete.**
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

  **✅ SKIPPED - All specifications were validated during their respective implementation loops.**

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ All 16 features |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ All 16 features |
| No ambiguity | ✅ All 16 features |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ All 16 features |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

  **✅ SKIPPED - Constitutional gates were validated during implementation.**

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | ✅ | ✅ |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | ✅ | ✅ |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | ✅ | ✅ |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:

  **✅ ALL FEATURES COMPLETE - No features in specify phase**
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**

  **✅ PLAYBOOK COMPLETE - No features remaining in any phase. 16/16 at 100%.**

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database
