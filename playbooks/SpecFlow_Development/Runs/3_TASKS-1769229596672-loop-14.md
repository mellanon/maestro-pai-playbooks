# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**:

  **NOTE (Loop 14):** ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE - No features in "plan" phase requiring task breakdown. Specflow status shows 15/16 complete, 1 skipped. This step document was generated as part of the standard workflow but does not apply - playbook has reached terminal state.
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**: N/A - No features in plan phase
  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`): N/A - No tasks to validate

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | N/A |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | N/A |
| Dependencies are explicit | N/A |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | N/A |

- [x] **Check task granularity**: N/A - No tasks to validate
  - [x] No task is too large (can be done in one session) - N/A
  - [x] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped) - N/A
  - [x] Each task has a verifiable outcome - N/A

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**: ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Result: 15/16 features complete, 1 skipped, 0 in progress. Playbook terminal state reached.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 4 (IMPLEMENT) to begin TDD implementation.
