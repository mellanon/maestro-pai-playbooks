# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

  **Note (Loop 3):** F-3 is already at phase `③ tasks` (beyond plan). Plan exists at `.specify/specs/f-3-concurrent-write-handling/plan.md`. All 143 tests pass.

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

  **Note (Loop 3):** F-3 already has tasks.md at `.specify/specs/f-3-concurrent-write-handling/tasks.md`. Contains 10 implementation tasks (T-1.1 through T-4.3) with T-1.1 already completed.

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`):

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | ✓ Each task has dedicated test file and acceptance criteria |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | ✓ Bullet-pointed acceptance per task |
| Dependencies are explicit | ✓ Dependencies: T-x.y or none listed |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | ✓ Phases/Groups follow dependency graph |

- [x] **Check task granularity**:
  - [x] No task is too large (can be done in one session) ✓ Each task is focused (types, acquire/release, stale detection, etc.)
  - [x] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped) ✓ T-4.1 groups all barrel exports appropriately
  - [x] Each task has a verifiable outcome ✓ All tasks have test requirements and acceptance criteria

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `③ tasks`

  **Verified (Loop 3):** F-3 shows phase `③ tasks`. All 143 tests pass.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present task breakdown to human for review before implementation.

Show:
1. `tasks.md` breakdown
2. Task dependencies
3. Estimated scope

**Only proceed to Step 4 after human approval.**
