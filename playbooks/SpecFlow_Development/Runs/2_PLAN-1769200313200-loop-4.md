# Step 2: PLAN - Create Technical Architecture

**Phase**: Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Create a technical architecture plan including data models, failure modes, and design decisions.

## Prerequisites

- Specification approved (spec.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "specify"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify spec exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `① specify`

  ✅ Verified: F-9 (Hook Timing Instrumentation) was at phase `① specify` with spec.md present at `.specify/specs/f-9-hook-timing-instrumentation/spec.md`

### 2. Create Technical Plan

- [x] **Run the plan phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow plan <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow plan F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  └── plan.md      ← Architecture decisions
  ```

  ✅ Executed: `specflow plan F-9` - created plan.md at `.specify/specs/f-9-hook-timing-instrumentation/plan.md`

### 3. Validate Plan Quality

- [x] **Check plan covers**:

| Section | Included? |
|---------|-----------|
| Data models | ✅ Yes - HookStartData, HookPhaseData, HookCompleteData types + TimingContext class |
| API/Interface design | ✅ Yes - TimingContext with start(), phase(), complete() methods |
| Error handling strategy | ✅ Yes - All methods wrapped in try/catch, graceful failure pattern |
| Failure modes | ✅ Yes - Risk assessment table with 5 risks and mitigations |
| Dependencies | ✅ Yes - Upstream (F-1, F-2, F-4) and downstream (VictoriaLogs, CLI tools) |
| Testing strategy | ✅ Yes - Phase 8 (unit tests) + Phase 9 (integration tests) |

- [x] **Check design against PAI principles**:

| Principle | Applied? |
|-----------|----------|
| Code before prompts | ✅ Yes - Pure TypeScript, no LLM calls |
| Deterministic where possible | ✅ Yes - Same hook produces same event structure |
| CLI-first interfaces | ✅ Yes - Events queryable via grep/jq from JSONL files |

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `② plan`

  ✅ Verified: F-9 now shows `② plan` phase - plan.md created with 9 implementation phases

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/plan.md` with technical architecture
- Feature phase updated to "plan"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 3 (TASKS) to break down implementation units.
