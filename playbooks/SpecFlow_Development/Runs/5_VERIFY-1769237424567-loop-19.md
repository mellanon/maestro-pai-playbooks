# Step 5: VERIFY - Quality Gates and Loop Control

**Phase**: Verification | **Loop Control**: Determines next action

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Verify implementation progress and determine whether to continue looping or proceed to completion.

## Instructions

### 1. Run Test Suite

- [x] **Execute all tests**:
  ```bash
  bun test
  # or project-specific test command
  ```

  **Result**: 460 tests passed, 0 failed, 1402 expect() calls, 19.69s

- [x] **Record results** in `.maestro/outputs/LOOP_TEST_RESULTS.md`:
  ```markdown
  # Test Results - Loop

  ## Summary
  - **Tests Run**: XX
  - **Tests Passed**: XX
  - **Tests Failed**: XX

  ## Output
  [Paste test output]
  ```

  **Recorded**: Loop 19 results documented with 460 tests, 0 failures

### 2. Check Feature Progress

- [x] **View current status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  **Result**: 16 features | 16 complete | 0 in progress | 0 pending | 0 skipped | Progress: 100%

- [x] **Validate feature phases complete**:
  ```bash
  specflow validate <feature-id>
  ```

  This checks:
  - spec.md exists and is valid
  - plan.md exists and is valid
  - tasks.md exists and tasks are complete

  **Result**: All 16 features validated - F-1 through F-016 all pass validation with spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md files present

### 3. Validate Against TDD-EVALS

- [x] **Check eval criteria**:

| Criterion | Pass? |
|-----------|-------|
| Tests are deterministic | ✅ Yes - 460 tests pass consistently |
| Outcomes verifiable | ✅ Yes - 1402 expect() assertions |
| Regression suite growing | ✅ Yes - comprehensive coverage across 15 test files |

**Result**: All TDD-EVALS criteria pass. Tests are deterministic, outcomes are verifiable via assertions, and the regression suite has grown to cover all 16 features.

### 4. Loop Decision

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Tests fail | → **Loop back to Step 4** (fix) |
| Tasks remain incomplete | → **Loop back to Step 4** (next task) |
| All tasks complete, tests pass | → **Proceed to Step 6** (complete) |
| Validation fails | → **STOP for human review** |

### Decision Logic

```
IF tests_failing:
    → Reset to Step 4, continue loop
ELIF incomplete_tasks > 0:
    → Reset to Step 4, continue loop
ELIF all_tasks_complete AND tests_pass:
    → Do NOT reset, proceed to Step 6
ELSE:
    → STOP for human review
```

## ✅ LOOP 19 DECISION: PROCEED TO STEP 6

**Evaluation:**
- Tests failing? NO (460/460 pass)
- Incomplete tasks? NO (16/16 features complete)
- All tasks complete AND tests pass? YES ✅

**Action: → Proceed to Step 6 (Complete Phase)**

## Output

- `.maestro/outputs/LOOP_TEST_RESULTS.md`

## Loop Control Settings

For Maestro Auto Run:
- **This document (5_VERIFY.md)**: `Reset: ON`
- **Step 4**: Gets reset by this document's logic
- **Steps 1-3**: `Reset: OFF` (run once, not in loop)

When this document completes:
- If loop continues: Reset to Step 4
- If done: Allow Step 6 to run
