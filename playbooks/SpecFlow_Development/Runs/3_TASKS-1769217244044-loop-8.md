# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

  **Result (Loop 8):** Checked status - no features at phase "② plan". F-11 (in_progress) is at "④ implement" with spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md all validated. 4 pending features (F-016, F-14, F-12, F-13) are at "○ none" - they need SPECIFY phase first. TASKS step prerequisites not met for any feature; F-11 has already completed this phase.

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [ ] **Run the tasks phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [ ] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`):

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | |
| Dependencies are explicit | |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | |

- [ ] **Check task granularity**:
  - [ ] No task is too large (can be done in one session)
  - [ ] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped)
  - [ ] Each task has a verifiable outcome

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [ ] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `③ tasks`

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 4 (IMPLEMENT) to begin TDD implementation.
