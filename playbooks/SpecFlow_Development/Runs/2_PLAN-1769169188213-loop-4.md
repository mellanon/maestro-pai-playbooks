# Step 2: PLAN - Create Technical Architecture

**Phase**: Planning | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Create a technical architecture plan including data models, failure modes, and design decisions.

## Prerequisites

- Specification approved (spec.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "specify"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify spec exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `① specify`

  **Loop 4 Note:** F-3 shows phase ③ tasks, confirming spec.md and plan.md exist. Feature is already past the plan phase.

### 2. Create Technical Plan

- [x] **Run the plan phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow plan <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow plan F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  └── plan.md      ← Architecture decisions
  ```

  **Loop 4 Note:** Plan already exists at `.specify/specs/f-3-concurrent-write-handling/plan.md` (29KB). Feature progressed to phase ③ tasks in prior loops.

### 3. Validate Plan Quality

- [x] **Check plan covers**:

| Section | Included? |
|---------|-----------|
| Data models | ✅ LockContent interface, file naming patterns |
| API/Interface design | ✅ acquireLock, releaseLock, mergeAgentFiles API contracts |
| Error handling strategy | ✅ Failure Modes section covers all scenarios |
| Failure modes | ✅ Comprehensive table: detection, behavior, recovery |
| Dependencies | ✅ Upstream (F-1, F-2, Node.js) and downstream documented |
| Testing strategy | ✅ Testing Checklist with 12 specific scenarios |

- [x] **Check design against PAI principles**:

| Principle | Applied? |
|-----------|----------|
| Code before prompts | ✅ Pure TypeScript implementation throughout |
| Deterministic where possible | ✅ Atomic file ops, clear algorithms, no randomness |
| CLI-first interfaces | ✅ mergeAgentFiles() utility for maintenance CLI |

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `② plan`

  **Loop 4 Note:** F-3 shows phase `③ tasks` - already beyond plan phase. All PLAN step requirements verified complete.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/plan.md` with technical architecture
- Feature phase updated to "plan"

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present plan to human for review before proceeding.

Show:
1. `plan.md` architecture decisions
2. Data models and interfaces
3. Failure modes and mitigations

**Only proceed to Step 3 after human approval.**
