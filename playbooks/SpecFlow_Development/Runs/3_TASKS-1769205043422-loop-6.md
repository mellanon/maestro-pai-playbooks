# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

  **Note (Loop 6):** F-10 is already at phase `③ tasks` - tasks phase was completed in previous loops. All spec files exist:
  - `.specify/specs/f-10-cli-query-patterns/spec.md` ✓
  - `.specify/specs/f-10-cli-query-patterns/plan.md` ✓
  - `.specify/specs/f-10-cli-query-patterns/tasks.md` ✓

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

  **Note (Loop 6):** Already completed in previous loop. Tasks.md shows T-1.1 and T-1.2 as complete.

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`):

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | ✓ Each T-2.x task has its own test file specified |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | ✓ Every task has Acceptance section with checkboxes |
| Dependencies are explicit | ✓ Each task lists Dependencies (e.g., "T-1.1", "T-1.2") |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | ✓ Foundation → Query Scripts → Testing → Finalization |

- [x] **Check task granularity**:
  - [x] No task is too large (can be done in one session) - Each task is a single script or component
  - [x] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped) - Related flags/features grouped per script
  - [x] Each task has a verifiable outcome - Exit codes, test files, acceptance criteria defined

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `③ tasks`

  **Verified (Loop 6):** `specflow status` shows F-10 at `◐ in_progress ③ tasks` - TASKS phase is complete, ready for IMPLEMENT phase.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 4 (IMPLEMENT) to begin TDD implementation.
