# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**: ✅ VERIFIED
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  **Status:** SpecFlow is initialized with 15 features:
  - 2 complete (F-1, F-2)
  - 0 in progress
  - 13 pending (including F-3 which is in `tasks` phase)
  - Current feature: F-3 (Concurrent Write Handling) - already past specify phase

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec: ✅ SKIPPED (already initialized)

  *Not applicable - SpecFlow is already initialized with 15 features as verified above.*

- [ ] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles

### 2. Check Current Status

- [ ] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

- [ ] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)

### 3. Create Specification

- [ ] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [ ] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | |
| Requirements are atomic | |
| No ambiguity | |
| Dependencies identified | |

- [ ] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | | |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | | |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | | |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [ ] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```

- [ ] **Confirm phase is "specify"**

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present spec to human for review before proceeding.

Show:
1. `spec.md` requirements
2. Feature description and rationale

**Only proceed to Step 2 after human approval.**
