# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  > **Loop 19 Status:** ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE. The `specflow` CLI does not exist in PATH, but the project state is tracked manually in `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`. All 16 features have been implemented:
  > - F-1 through F-15: Event infrastructure, hooks, Vector stack
  > - F-016: Skill Invocation Enforcement
  > Total: 16 features complete (100%)

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  > N/A - Already initialized and completed. The `.specify/specs/` directory contains specifications for all 16 features.

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles
  > N/A - No new features to specify.

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  > `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` shows ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  > **Result:** No pending features. All 16 features are complete.

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  > **SKIPPED:** No features remaining to specify. All specifications exist in `.specify/specs/`.

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:
  > **SKIPPED:** No new specifications created this loop.

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:
  > **SKIPPED:** No new specifications created this loop.

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  > ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE confirmed in `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  > **Result:** Playbook complete. No further SPECIFY work needed.

## Output

- ✅ All 16 feature specifications exist in `.specify/specs/`
- ✅ CURRENT_FEATURE.md shows ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE

## Next

→ **Playbook Complete.** Recommended next steps from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`:
1. Create PR for feature branch
2. Run PR_Review playbook for self-review (optional)
3. Merge to main
