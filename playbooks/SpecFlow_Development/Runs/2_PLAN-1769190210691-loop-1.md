# Step 2: PLAN - Create Technical Architecture

**Phase**: Planning | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Create a technical architecture plan including data models, failure modes, and design decisions.

## Prerequisites

- Specification approved (spec.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "specify"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify spec exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `① specify`

  **Note (2026-01-24):** F-15 is already in phase `④ implement`. Spec exists at `.specify/specs/f-15-docker-compose-stack/spec.md` ✓

### 2. Create Technical Plan

- [x] **Run the plan phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow plan <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow plan F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  └── plan.md      ← Architecture decisions
  ```

  **Note (2026-01-24):** Plan already exists at `.specify/specs/f-15-docker-compose-stack/plan.md` with comprehensive architecture including:
  - Victoria* stack architecture diagram
  - Technology stack with pinned image versions
  - Port allocation (corrected from spec)
  - API contracts for all services
  - Implementation phases (1-4)
  - Risk assessment and security considerations

### 3. Validate Plan Quality

- [x] **Check plan covers**:

| Section | Included? |
|---------|-----------|
| Data models | ✓ Volume structure with Docker named volumes |
| API/Interface design | ✓ Full API contracts for VictoriaMetrics, VictoriaLogs, VictoriaTraces |
| Error handling strategy | ✓ Health checks with retry logic (30s interval, 10s timeout, 3 retries) |
| Failure modes | ✓ Risk assessment table with mitigations |
| Dependencies | ✓ Prerequisites and external services documented |
| Testing strategy | ✓ Phase 4 validation tasks (T-4.1, T-4.2, T-4.3) |

- [x] **Check design against PAI principles**:

| Principle | Applied? |
|-----------|----------|
| Code before prompts | ✓ Docker Compose YAML, not prompts |
| Deterministic where possible | ✓ Pinned image versions, deterministic startup |
| CLI-first interfaces | ✓ manage.sh stack-* commands |

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `② plan`

  **Note (2026-01-24):** F-15 is beyond plan phase - currently in `④ implement` with:
  - T-1.1 (docker-compose.yml) ☑ Complete
  - T-1.2 (Grafana datasources) ☑ Complete
  - 9 remaining tasks in progress

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/plan.md` with technical architecture
- Feature phase updated to "plan"

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present plan to human for review before proceeding.

Show:
1. `plan.md` architecture decisions
2. Data models and interfaces
3. Failure modes and mitigations

**Only proceed to Step 3 after human approval.**
