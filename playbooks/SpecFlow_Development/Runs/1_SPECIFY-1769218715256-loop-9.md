# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  > SpecFlow initialized: 16 features | 12 complete | 4 pending

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  > N/A - Already initialized

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles
  > Note: PAI-PRINCIPLES.md not found in project, validated against inline criteria

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  > Viewed: F-12 (Vector Configuration) is next pending feature

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  > Current feature: F-12 Vector Configuration (from CURRENT_FEATURE.md)

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify F-12
  ```
  > Spec created manually at `.specify/specs/f-12-vector-configuration/spec.md`
  > (specflow specify requires interactive input, created spec directly)

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/specs/f-12-vector-configuration/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | YES - Each FR has specific validation criteria |
| Requirements are atomic | YES - Each requirement is self-contained |
| No ambiguity | YES - Configuration values are explicit with TOML examples |
| Dependencies identified | YES - Dependencies section clearly defined (F-2, F-11, F-15) |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | YES | YES - Static config file |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | YES | YES - Uses Vector CLI conventions |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | YES | YES - Config does one thing: collect and ship logs |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="F-12")'
  ```
  > Status: pending, Phase: specify, specPath: .specify/specs/f-12-vector-configuration/spec.md

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  > Confirmed: F-12 is now in "specify" phase

## Output

- `.specify/specs/f-12-vector-configuration/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database (phase = "specify")

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 2 (PLAN) to create technical architecture.
