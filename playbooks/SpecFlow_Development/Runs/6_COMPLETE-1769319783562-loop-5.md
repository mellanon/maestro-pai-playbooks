# Step 6: COMPLETE - Validation and Finalization

**Phase**: Completion | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Validate all phases complete and mark the feature as done.

## Prerequisites

- All tests passing
- All tasks complete
- Step 5 loop control indicates completion

## Phase Guard (MUST RUN FIRST) - CRITICAL

**This step MUST NOT run until all tasks are complete.** Before doing any work:

- [x] **Check if this step should execute**: SKIPPED - Phase guard returned: `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE` found in `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`. All 18 features implemented. Playbook complete.

**If phase guard returns SKIP:** Mark ALL remaining tasks below as `[x] SKIPPED - Phase guard` and proceed to next document. This prevents stall detection from flagging unchecked boxes.

## Instructions

### 1. Final Validation

- [x] **Run comprehensive validation**: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

### 2. Run Final Tests

- [x] **Execute full test suite**: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

- [x] **Run type checking** (if applicable): SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

### 3. Mark Feature Complete

- [x] **Complete the feature**: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

### 4. Review Doctorow Gate

The `specflow complete` command includes the **Doctorow Gate** - a checklist ensuring quality:

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Tests exist and pass | N/A - All features complete |
| No unnecessary complexity added | N/A - All features complete |
| Code follows existing patterns | N/A - All features complete |
| Documentation updated if needed | N/A - All features complete |

### 5. Verify Completion

- [x] **Check final status**: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

### 6. Update Changelog

- [x] **Generate changelog entry from spec**: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

- [x] **Update CHANGELOG.md**: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

### 7. Sanitization Checklist

Before creating PR, verify no sensitive data is included.

- [x] **Check for secrets**: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

- [x] **Check for personal paths**: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

- [x] **Check for hardcoded usernames**: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

- [x] **Verify config externalized**: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

### 8. Create File Inventory

- [x] **List files for PR** in `.maestro/outputs/FILE_INVENTORY.md`: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

### 9. Prepare for Next Feature

- [x] **Check if more features pending**: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

## Output

- Feature marked complete in database
- `CHANGELOG.md` updated with feature entry
- `.maestro/outputs/FILE_INVENTORY.md` with PR file list
- `.maestro/outputs/COMPLETION.md` summary

## Post-Completion

When ready to release:
```bash
# Stage changes
git add <specific files>

# Create commit
git commit -m "feat: [feature description]

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create --title "[title]" --body "..."
```

## Optional: Self-Review with PR_Review Playbook

After creating the PR, optionally run the **PR_Review** playbook for self-review.

## Feature Loop: Initialize Next Feature

After completing a feature, the playbook MUST check for and initialize the next feature.

### 10. Clear Current Feature State

- [x] **Archive completed feature context**: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

### 11. Check for Next Feature

- [x] **List remaining pending features (by ID order)**: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

### 12. Initialize Next Feature

- [x] **Create new CURRENT_FEATURE.md for next feature**: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

- [x] **Check if feature needs spec initialization**: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

### 13. Reset Playbook for Next Feature

- [x] **Clear loop artifacts from previous feature**: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

- [x] **Log feature transition**: SKIPPED - Phase guard (ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE)

## Loop Control

After completing Tasks 10-13, the playbook loops back to **Step 0 (SELECT_FEATURE)** to begin the next feature cycle.

**Loop continues until:**
- All features are complete (`specflow list --status pending` returns empty)
- Max loops reached (configurable in Maestro)
- Manual stop by user

---

## Playbook Complete (Final Exit)

The playbook only exits when `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` contains `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE`.

At that point:
1. All features have been implemented
2. PR_Review playbook can be run for final review
3. Session ends

---

## Execution Notes (Loop 5)

**Phase Guard Result:** SKIP - ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE

The playbook has fully completed. All 18 features have been implemented with 708 tests passing. No further work is required for this step.
