# Step 2: PLAN - Create Technical Architecture

**Phase**: Planning | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Create a technical architecture plan including data models, failure modes, and design decisions.

## Prerequisites

- Specification approved (spec.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "specify"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify spec exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `① specify`

  ✅ Verified: F-3 (Concurrent Write Handling) shows phase: `① specify` and spec exists at `.specify/specs/f-3-concurrent-write-handling/spec.md`

### 2. Create Technical Plan

- [x] **Run the plan phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow plan <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow plan F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  └── plan.md      ← Architecture decisions
  ```

  ✅ Executed: `specflow plan F-3` - Created comprehensive plan at `.specify/specs/f-3-concurrent-write-handling/plan.md`

### 3. Validate Plan Quality

- [x] **Check plan covers**:

| Section | Included? |
|---------|-----------|
| Data models | ✅ Lock File, Fallback File, LockOptions interface, Extended Settings Schema |
| API/Interface design | ✅ Full locking.ts exports with JSDoc contracts, enhanced logEvent() flow |
| Error handling strategy | ✅ try/finally for lock release, stderr logging, graceful degradation |
| Failure modes | ✅ Risk Assessment table with 7 risks, impacts, and mitigations |
| Dependencies | ✅ Internal (F-1, F-2) and External (node:fs, bun:test) documented |
| Testing strategy | ✅ Unit, Integration, Manual validation - Test Strategy Summary table |

- [x] **Check design against PAI principles**:

| Principle | Applied? |
|-----------|----------|
| Code before prompts | ✅ Pure TypeScript implementation, no prompts - rename-based locking is deterministic code |
| Deterministic where possible | ✅ POSIX atomic rename guarantees; timeout-based fallback is predictable |
| CLI-first interfaces | ✅ Integrates with existing specflow CLI; settings.json configuration |

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `② plan`

  ✅ Verified: F-3 (Concurrent Write Handling) now shows phase: `② plan`

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/plan.md` with technical architecture
- Feature phase updated to "plan"

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present plan to human for review before proceeding.

Show:
1. `plan.md` architecture decisions
2. Data models and interfaces
3. Failure modes and mitigations

**Only proceed to Step 3 after human approval.**
