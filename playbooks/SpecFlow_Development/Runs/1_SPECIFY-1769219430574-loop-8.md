# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ SpecFlow already initialized with 16 features (13 complete, 3 pending at start of this loop)

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  N/A - Already initialized

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ Checked status - F-12 was in CURRENT_FEATURE.md but was a duplicate of F-11

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  ✅ F-12 (Vector Configuration) skipped - already implemented by F-11
  ✅ F-14 (Log Rotation Script) selected as next pending feature (priority 3)
  ✅ Updated CURRENT_FEATURE.md to F-14

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify F-14
  ```

  ✅ Created spec manually at `.specify/specs/f-14-log-rotation-script/spec.md`
  ✅ Spec includes:
  - 4 user scenarios with acceptance criteria
  - 7 functional requirements with code examples
  - 4 non-functional requirements
  - Complete script structure
  - Launchd plist configuration
  - Test strategy
  - Constitutional gate validation

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ Each success criterion maps to a test |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ Single script, clear components |
| No ambiguity | ✅ Complete script structure provided |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ F-2 stated as upstream |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | Yes | ✅ Bash script, deterministic |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | Yes | ✅ --dry-run, --install flags |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | Yes | ✅ Single purpose: rotate logs |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow phase F-14 specify
  ```
  ✅ Updated F-14 phase: none → specify

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  ✅ F-14 is now in "specify" phase

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database
