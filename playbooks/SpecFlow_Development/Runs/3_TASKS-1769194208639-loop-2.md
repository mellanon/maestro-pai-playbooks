# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

  **Note:** F-6 already at phase `③ tasks` (tasks already created by previous agent). spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md all exist in `.specify/specs/f-6-sessionstop-hook-instrumentation/`.

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

  **Note:** Tasks already created. tasks.md contains 11 well-defined implementation tasks (T-1.1 through T-4.3) organized in 4 groups: Foundation, Core Logic, Integration, and Testing.

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`):

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | ✅ All tasks marked with [T] and reference specific test files |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | ✅ Each task has explicit acceptance criteria checkboxes |
| Dependencies are explicit | ✅ Dependencies listed (e.g., T-1.2 depends on T-1.1, T-2.1 depends on T-1.3) |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | ✅ Execution order documented: Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 |

- [x] **Check task granularity**:
  - [x] No task is too large (can be done in one session) - Each task focuses on single interface/function
  - [x] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped) - Related changes grouped (T-1.1-1.3 for TranscriptParser)
  - [x] Each task has a verifiable outcome - All have acceptance criteria with testable conditions

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `③ tasks`

  **Verified:** `specflow status` shows F-6 at phase `③ tasks` - ready for IMPLEMENT phase.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 4 (IMPLEMENT) to begin TDD implementation.
