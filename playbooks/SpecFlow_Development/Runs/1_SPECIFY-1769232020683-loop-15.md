# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  > ✅ Loop 15: SpecFlow is fully initialized with 16 features at 100% completion. No initialization needed.

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.
  > ✅ Loop 15: N/A - Already initialized with all 16 features complete.

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles
  > ✅ Loop 15: N/A - No new features to specify. All features already validated and complete.

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  > ✅ Loop 15: Status shows 16 features | 16 complete | 0 in progress | 0 pending | 0 skipped = 100%

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  > ✅ Loop 15: CURRENT_FEATURE.md states "ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE" - no pending features to specify.

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```
  > ✅ Loop 15: N/A - No pending features. All 16 features (F-1 through F-016) have completed specifications.

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ |
| No ambiguity | ✅ |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ |

> ✅ Loop 15: All completed features passed validation in prior loops.

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | ✅ | ✅ |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | ✅ | ✅ |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | ✅ | ✅ |

> ✅ Loop 15: All features validated against PAI principles in prior loops.

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```
  > ✅ Loop 15: All 16 features at phase "implement" with status "complete".

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  > ✅ Loop 15: All features have progressed through specify → plan → tasks → implement. Playbook complete.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

> ✅ Loop 15: All 16 feature specifications exist in `.specify/` directory. Database shows 100% completion.

## Next

→ **PROJECT COMPLETE**: All 16 features have been implemented. No more SPECIFY work needed.
→ Next steps: Create PR for feature/signal-agent-2 branch, run PR_Review playbook, merge to main.
