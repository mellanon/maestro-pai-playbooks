# Step 5: VERIFY - Quality Gates and Loop Control

**Phase**: Verification | **Loop Control**: Determines next action

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Verify implementation progress and determine whether to continue looping or proceed to completion.

## Instructions

### 1. Run Test Suite

- [x] **Execute all tests**:
  ```bash
  bun test
  # or project-specific test command
  ```
  **Result:** 364 tests pass, 0 fail, 1203 expect() calls in 5.32s

- [x] **Record results** in `.maestro/outputs/LOOP_TEST_RESULTS.md`:
  **Recorded:** Loop 3 Test Results - VERIFY Phase with full details

### 2. Check Feature Progress

- [x] **View current status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  **Result:** 16 features | 7 complete | 0 in progress | 9 pending (44%)
  F-7 is in "tasks" phase, all 7 tasks marked complete in tasks.md

- [x] **Validate feature phases complete**:
  ```bash
  specflow validate F-7
  ```
  **Result:** F-7 validated - spec.md (14045 bytes), plan.md (18217 bytes), tasks.md (10777 bytes) all present.
  Warning: docs.md not yet created (required before `specflow complete`)

  This checks:
  - ✅ spec.md exists and is valid
  - ✅ plan.md exists and is valid
  - ✅ tasks.md exists and tasks are complete (7/7 tasks marked ✅)

### 3. Validate Against TDD-EVALS

- [x] **Check eval criteria**:

| Criterion | Pass? |
|-----------|-------|
| Tests are deterministic | ✅ Yes - all 364 tests pass consistently |
| Outcomes verifiable | ✅ Yes - hook exists, settings configured, events emit |
| Regression suite growing | ✅ Yes - 29 new tests added for F-7 |

### 4. Loop Decision

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Tests fail | → **Loop back to Step 4** (fix) |
| Tasks remain incomplete | → **Loop back to Step 4** (next task) |
| All tasks complete, tests pass | → **Proceed to Step 6** (complete) |
| Validation fails | → **STOP for human review** |

### Decision Logic

```
IF tests_failing:
    → Reset to Step 4, continue loop
ELIF incomplete_tasks > 0:
    → Reset to Step 4, continue loop
ELIF all_tasks_complete AND tests_pass:
    → Do NOT reset, proceed to Step 6
ELSE:
    → STOP for human review
```

## Output

- `.maestro/outputs/LOOP_TEST_RESULTS.md`

## Loop Control Settings

For Maestro Auto Run:
- **This document (5_VERIFY.md)**: `Reset: ON`
- **Step 4**: Gets reset by this document's logic
- **Steps 1-3**: `Reset: OFF` (run once, not in loop)

When this document completes:
- If loop continues: Reset to Step 4
- If done: Allow Step 6 to run

---

## Loop 3 Decision

**Analysis:**
- Tests passing: ✅ (364/364)
- Tasks complete: ✅ (7/7 in tasks.md)
- TDD-EVALS: ✅ (all criteria pass)
- docs.md: ⚠️ Missing (but created in Step 6 COMPLETE phase)

**Decision: → PROCEED TO STEP 6 (COMPLETE)**

All tasks are marked complete in tasks.md and all tests pass. The docs.md file will be created as part of the COMPLETE phase before running `specflow complete`.
