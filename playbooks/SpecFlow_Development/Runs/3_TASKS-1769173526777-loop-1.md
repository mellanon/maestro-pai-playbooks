# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

  *Verified: F-5 was in phase `② plan` before running tasks command.*

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

  *Completed: Ran `specflow tasks F-5`. Created tasks.md at `.specify/specs/f-5-sessionstart-hook-instrumentation/tasks.md` with 6 tasks in 3 groups.*

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`):

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | ✅ T-1.1 validates via compilation, T-1.2/T-2.1/T-2.2/T-3.1 have explicit test files |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | ✅ Each task has "Validation" or "Test Cases" sections |
| Dependencies are explicit | ✅ Each task lists dependencies (T-1.1 none, T-1.2→T-1.1, etc.) |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | ✅ Execution order diagram shows dependency flow |

- [x] **Check task granularity**:
  - [x] No task is too large (can be done in one session) - *Largest is T-3.1 with ~100 lines of tests*
  - [x] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped) - *T-1.1 is a single import but logically separated for dependency clarity*
  - [x] Each task has a verifiable outcome - *Compilation, tests, or script output for each task*

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `③ tasks`

  *Verified: F-5 now shows phase `③ tasks` in specflow status.*

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present task breakdown to human for review before implementation.

Show:
1. `tasks.md` breakdown
2. Task dependencies
3. Estimated scope

**Only proceed to Step 4 after human approval.**
