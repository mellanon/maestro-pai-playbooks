# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### ✅ PLAYBOOK COMPLETE

All 16 features have been successfully implemented and verified. `specflow status` confirms:
- **16 features complete** (100% progress)
- All features at phase `④ implement` with status `● complete`

**Features Completed:**
| ID | Name | Priority |
|----|------|----------|
| F-1 | Event Schema and Types | 1 |
| F-15 | Docker Compose Stack | 1 |
| F-016 | Skill Invocation Enforcement | 2 |
| F-2 | Event Logging Library | 2 |
| F-10 | CLI Query Patterns | 3 |
| F-11 | Vector Collector Service | 3 |
| F-3 | Concurrent Write Handling | 3 |
| F-4 | PII Scrubbing | 3 |
| F-5 | SessionStart Hook Instrumentation | 3 |
| F-7 | PreToolUse Hook Instrumentation | 3 |
| F-9 | Hook Timing Instrumentation | 3 |
| F-13 | Vector Health Watchdog | 4 |
| F-6 | SessionStop Hook Instrumentation | 4 |
| F-8 | PostToolUse Hook Instrumentation | 4 |
| F-12 | Vector Configuration | 5 |
| F-14 | Log Rotation Script | 7 |

- [x] **All tasks phases completed** - All 16 features have spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, docs.md, and verify.md files
- [x] **All implementations verified** - Features transitioned through all phases to complete status

No remaining work in this playbook.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 4 (IMPLEMENT) to begin TDD implementation.
