# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

  **✅ Verified:** F-3 was in phase `② plan` with complete spec.md and plan.md files at `.specify/specs/f-3-concurrent-write-handling/`

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

  **✅ Completed:** Ran `specflow tasks F-3` which created tasks.md with 11 implementation tasks organized into 6 groups

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`):

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | ✅ All 11 tasks have `[T]` marker with explicit test file locations |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | ✅ Every task has detailed acceptance criteria with checkboxes |
| Dependencies are explicit | ✅ Each task lists dependencies (e.g., T-2.2 → T-1.1, T-1.3, T-2.1) |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | ✅ Clear dependency graph with execution order provided |

- [x] **Check task granularity**:
  - [x] No task is too large (can be done in one session) — Each task is a single function or small test suite
  - [x] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped) — Related items grouped (e.g., T-1.3 has both path helpers)
  - [x] Each task has a verifiable outcome — Every task has specific acceptance criteria and test verification

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `③ tasks`

  **✅ Verified:** F-3 now shows `○ pending     ③ tasks     3         Concurrent Write Handling`

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present task breakdown to human for review before implementation.

Show:
1. `tasks.md` breakdown
2. Task dependencies
3. Estimated scope

**Only proceed to Step 4 after human approval.**
