# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

  > **Note (Signal-2):** F-15 (Docker Compose Stack) is already in phase `④ implement`, meaning the tasks phase has been completed. The plan.md exists at `.specify/specs/f-15-docker-compose-stack/plan.md`.

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

  > **Note (Signal-2):** tasks.md already exists at `.specify/specs/f-15-docker-compose-stack/tasks.md` with 11 implementation tasks across 4 groups (Foundation, Management Script Integration, Documentation, Validation). Progress: T-1.1, T-1.2, T-2.1 complete; 8 tasks remaining.

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`):

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | ✓ Each task has explicit "Test:" field |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | ✓ Each task has checkboxes with criteria |
| Dependencies are explicit | ✓ "Dependencies:" field on each task |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | ✓ "Execution Order" section at bottom |

- [x] **Check task granularity**:
  - [x] No task is too large (can be done in one session)
  - [x] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped)
  - [x] Each task has a verifiable outcome

  > **Note (Signal-2):** Tasks are well-structured: single file creations/modifications per task, all stack-* commands are separate but related, and each has acceptance criteria with verifiable outcomes.

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `③ tasks`

  > **Note (Signal-2):** F-15 is actually in phase `④ implement`, which means the tasks phase (③) has been completed and approved. Implementation is underway with 3 of 11 tasks complete.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present task breakdown to human for review before implementation.

Show:
1. `tasks.md` breakdown
2. Task dependencies
3. Estimated scope

**Only proceed to Step 4 after human approval.**
