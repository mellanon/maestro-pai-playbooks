# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

  ✅ Verified: F-9 shows `② plan` status. Plan file exists at `.specify/specs/f-9-hook-timing-instrumentation/plan.md` (20,859 bytes)

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

  ✅ Completed: `specflow tasks F-9` successfully created `tasks.md` with 9 tasks in 3 groups:
  - Group 1: Foundation (T-1.1 to T-1.3) - TimingContext class, export, tests
  - Group 2: Hook Instrumentation (T-2.1 to T-2.5) - 5 hooks, parallelizable
  - Group 3: Integration Testing (T-3.1) - Final verification

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`):

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | ✅ T-1.3 provides unit tests, each hook task has acceptance criteria checklist |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | ✅ Each task has "Acceptance Criteria" section with checkboxes |
| Dependencies are explicit | ✅ Each task lists dependencies (e.g., "Dependencies: T-1.1, T-1.2") |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | ✅ Foundation (T-1.x) → Hook Instrumentation (T-2.x) → Integration (T-3.1) |

- [x] **Check task granularity**:
  - [x] No task is too large (can be done in one session) ✅ Each task is ~10-80 lines of code
  - [x] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped) ✅ Export task (T-1.2) is minimal but necessary for module structure
  - [x] Each task has a verifiable outcome ✅ All tasks have acceptance criteria checklists + verification commands for integration testing

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `③ tasks`

  ✅ Verified: `specflow status` shows F-9 with phase `③ tasks`

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 4 (IMPLEMENT) to begin TDD implementation.
