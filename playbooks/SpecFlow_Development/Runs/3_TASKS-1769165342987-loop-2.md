# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**: ✓ Verified F-3 at phase "plan" with plan.md present at `/Users/andreas/Developer/pai/versions/worktrees/signal-agent-2/.specify/specs/f-3-concurrent-write-handling/plan.md`
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**: ✓ Executed `specflow tasks F-3` which created `/Users/andreas/Developer/pai/versions/worktrees/signal-agent-2/.specify/specs/f-3-concurrent-write-handling/tasks.md` with 10 atomic tasks in 4 groups:
  - Group 1: Lock Module Foundation (T-1.1, T-1.2, T-1.3)
  - Group 2: logEvent Integration (T-2.1, T-2.2)
  - Group 3: Merge Utility (T-3.1, T-3.2)
  - Group 4: Integration and Polish (T-4.1, T-4.2, T-4.3)

  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`): ✓ All criteria validated

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | ✓ Every task specifies test file location (e.g., `lock.test.ts`, `merge.test.ts`) |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | ✓ All 10 tasks have detailed "Acceptance:" sections with bullet points |
| Dependencies are explicit | ✓ Each task has "Dependencies:" line (e.g., T-2.1 depends on T-1.2, T-1.3) |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | ✓ Execution order diagram shows 5 phases with proper dependency flow |

- [x] **Check task granularity**: ✓ All tasks appropriately sized
  - [x] No task is too large (can be done in one session): ✓ Each task is focused (e.g., T-1.1 just types/constants, T-1.2 just acquire/release)
  - [x] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped): ✓ Related items grouped (e.g., T-4.1 exports all new functions together)
  - [x] Each task has a verifiable outcome: ✓ All tasks have acceptance criteria with testable conditions

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**: ✓ F-3 now shows `③ tasks` phase
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `③ tasks`

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present task breakdown to human for review before implementation.

Show:
1. `tasks.md` breakdown
2. Task dependencies
3. Estimated scope

**Only proceed to Step 4 after human approval.**
