# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  > ✅ SpecFlow initialized with 16 features, 56% complete (9 complete, 7 pending)

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.
  > ✅ Already initialized - skipped

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles
  > ⚠️ File not present in this worktree - validated against general principles from existing specs

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  > ✅ F-9 "Hook Timing Instrumentation" identified as next feature (priority 3, status: pending → specify)

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  > ✅ F-9 selected from CURRENT_FEATURE.md - needs SPECIFY phase

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```
  > ✅ Created `.specify/specs/f-9-hook-timing-instrumentation/spec.md` with detailed HookTimer utility specification

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ All FRs have explicit validation criteria with unit/integration tests |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ Each FR is a single focused requirement (8 FRs defined) |
| No ambiguity | ✅ Code samples provided, event structures explicitly defined in TypeScript |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ F-1, F-2, F-4 dependencies documented with contracts |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | Yes | ✅ Timer uses Date.now() for deterministic timing |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | No | N/A - This is a library utility, not CLI |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | Yes | ✅ HookTimer does one thing: hook timing instrumentation |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```
  > ✅ F-9 status verified

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  > ✅ F-9 phase updated to "specify" via `specflow phase F-9 specify`

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database
