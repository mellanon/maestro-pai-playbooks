# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

  ✅ **Status Check:** Ran `specflow status` - F-12 (Vector Configuration) is already marked as `● complete` with phase `④ implement`. The TASKS phase for this feature was already executed in a previous loop iteration. No features are currently in `② plan` phase requiring task breakdown.

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**: N/A - No feature in plan phase requiring task breakdown. F-12 already complete.

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern**: N/A - No new tasks created this iteration.

- [x] **Check task granularity**: N/A - No new tasks created this iteration.

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**: N/A - F-12 is already complete. No pending work in this iteration.

---

## Summary

**No work performed:** This TASKS step found no features in `② plan` phase. F-12 (Vector Configuration) was the last active feature and has already completed through the full SpecFlow lifecycle to `● complete` status.

**Remaining pending features** (require SPECIFY phase first):
- F-016: Skill Invocation Enforcement (priority 2)
- F-14: Log Rotation Script (priority 3)
- F-13: Vector Health Watchdog (priority 4)

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 4 (IMPLEMENT) to begin TDD implementation.
