# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ SpecFlow is initialized with 16 features (14 complete, 1 pending F-13, 1 skipped)

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.
  ✅ Already initialized - skipped

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles
  ✅ Validated against PAI principles inline in spec (see Constitutional Gate Validation section)

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ F-13 (Vector Health Watchdog) identified as next pending feature

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  ✅ F-13 - Vector Health Watchdog: launchd watchdog checking Vector /health endpoint, Telegram alerts after 3 failures

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```
  ✅ Created `.specify/specs/f-13-vector-health-watchdog/spec.md` manually (specflow specify failed to create file)

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ 12 success criteria with clear pass/fail |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ Single script with clear components |
| No ambiguity | ✅ Complete script structure, expected output provided |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ F-11, F-15 explicitly listed |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | Yes | ✅ Bash script, deterministic behavior |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | Yes | ✅ CLI flags: --once, --install |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | Yes | ✅ Single purpose: monitor Vector health |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```
  ✅ F-13 status updated to in_progress, phase = specify

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  ✅ Phase confirmed as "specify" in SpecFlow status

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

✅ **SPECIFY phase complete for F-13 Vector Health Watchdog**

Spec created at: `.specify/specs/f-13-vector-health-watchdog/spec.md`
- 615 lines covering all functional requirements
- 12 success criteria
- 5 design decisions documented
- Constitutional gates validated
