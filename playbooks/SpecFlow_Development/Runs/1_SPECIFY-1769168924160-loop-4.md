# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ *Loop 4: SpecFlow is initialized. 15 features total, 2 complete (F-1, F-2), F-3 is current.*

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.

  ✅ *Loop 4: Already initialized - N/A*

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles

  ✅ *Loop 4: docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md does not exist in this project. Spec was validated against PAI founding principles during prior approval.*

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ *Loop 4: Status shows F-3 (Concurrent Write Handling) in phase "tasks" - spec already approved*

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)

  ✅ *Loop 4: Current feature is F-3 - "Concurrent Write Handling" - already past SPECIFY phase*

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```

  ✅ *Loop 4: Spec already exists at `.specify/specs/f-3-concurrent-write-handling/spec.md` (361 lines)*

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ All scenarios have acceptance criteria with checkboxes |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ Broken into FR-1 through FR-6 |
| No ambiguity | ✅ Code examples provided for each function |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ Depends on F-1, F-2 (documented) |

*Loop 4: docs/TDD-EVALS.md does not exist. Validated spec against standard TDD criteria.*

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | Yes - lock algorithm is deterministic | ✅ |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | No - internal library | N/A |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | Yes - lock.ts and merge.ts are focused | ✅ |

*Loop 4: docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md does not exist. Validated against PAI founding principles.*

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```

  ✅ *Loop 4: F-3 status shows phase="tasks" - already past SPECIFY phase*

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**

  ✅ *Loop 4: F-3 is in phase "tasks" (10 tasks, 2 complete). SPECIFY phase was completed in prior loops.*

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present spec to human for review before proceeding.

Show:
1. `spec.md` requirements
2. Feature description and rationale

**Only proceed to Step 2 after human approval.**
