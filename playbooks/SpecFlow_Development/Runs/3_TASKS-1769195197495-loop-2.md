# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

  ✅ Verified: F-7 (PreToolUse Hook Instrumentation) is at phase `② plan`

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

  ✅ Ran `specflow tasks F-7` - created tasks.md with 8 tasks in 3 groups (Hook Implementation, Configuration, Testing)

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`):

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | ✅ Each task has [T] marker for testable tasks with specific test cases |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | ✅ All 8 tasks have explicit acceptance criteria with checkboxes |
| Dependencies are explicit | ✅ Each task lists dependencies (e.g., "Dependencies: T-1.3") |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | ✅ Execution order documented with 4 phases |

- [x] **Check task granularity**:
  - [x] No task is too large (can be done in one session) ✅ Tasks are atomic: create file, add imports, parse input, emit event, etc.
  - [x] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped) ✅ T-1.1 groups shebang+header, T-1.4 groups all tool events
  - [x] Each task has a verifiable outcome ✅ Verification commands provided for type check, tests, and manual testing

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `③ tasks`

  ✅ Verified: F-7 now shows `③ tasks` phase - task breakdown complete

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 4 (IMPLEMENT) to begin TDD implementation.
