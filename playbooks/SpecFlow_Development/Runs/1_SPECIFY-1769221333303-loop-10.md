# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ SpecFlow already initialized with 16 features (81% complete, 13 complete, 3 pending)

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  N/A - Already initialized

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Not present in this project; used existing PAI patterns from hooks/lib/notifications.ts and VoiceServer for design guidance

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ Verified: F-13 Vector Health Watchdog is next pending feature (priority 4)

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  ✅ F-13 Vector Health Watchdog identified from CURRENT_FEATURE.md

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  Manually created spec.md due to specflow specify requiring interactive input.
  Created `.specify/specs/f-13-vector-health-watchdog/spec.md` with comprehensive specification including:
  - 4 user scenarios (Vector down, VictoriaLogs down, recovery, history review)
  - 8 functional requirements (watchdog script, health checks, notifications, debouncing, heartbeat, logging, launchd plist, manage.sh integration)
  - Non-functional requirements (performance, reliability, security)
  - Dependencies on F-11, F-12, F-15, VoiceServer, ntfy
  - Success criteria and assumptions

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✅ Each FR has specific behavior and validation criteria |
| Requirements are atomic | ✅ Each FR covers single concern (health check, notification, debouncing, etc.) |
| No ambiguity | ✅ Specific endpoints, timeouts, file formats defined |
| Dependencies identified | ✅ F-11, F-12, F-15, VoiceServer, ntfy listed with contracts |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | ✅ Yes | ✅ Bash script with predictable state machine |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | ✅ Yes | ✅ manage.sh watchdog-* commands |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Single script for health monitoring only |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow phase F-13 specify
  ```
  ✅ Updated F-13 phase: none → specify

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  ✅ Confirmed via specflow status: F-13 now shows "① specify" phase

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database
