# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  > **COMPLETED:** SpecFlow is initialized with 16 features (10 complete, 6 pending, 63% progress)

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.
  > **SKIPPED:** Already initialized

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles
  > **NOTE:** PAI-PRINCIPLES.md and TDD-EVALS.md do not exist in this project. Proceeding with standard spec quality patterns.

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  > **COMPLETED:** 16 features visible, F-10 is next pending feature

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  > **COMPLETED:** F-10 "CLI Query Patterns" identified via `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```
  > **COMPLETED:** Created `.specify/specs/f-10-cli-query-patterns/spec.md` with comprehensive specification including:
  > - 5 user scenarios (errors-today, session-duration, api-costs, slow-hooks, skill-usage)
  > - 6 functional requirements with complete shell script implementations
  > - Non-functional requirements for compatibility and performance
  > - Dependency mapping and success criteria

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | ✓ Each script has validation criteria |
| Requirements are atomic | ✓ Each script is independent |
| No ambiguity | ✓ Scripts include exact bash implementations |
| Dependencies identified | ✓ F-1, F-2, jq dependency documented |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | Yes | ✓ Scripts use standard UNIX tools |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | Yes | ✓ All scripts are CLI tools |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | Yes | ✓ Each script does one thing well |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```
  > **COMPLETED:** F-10 status is "in_progress", phase is "specify"

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  > **CONFIRMED:** Phase is "specify"

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database
