# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

  ✅ Verified: F-4 (PII Scrubbing) shows phase: `② plan`

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

  ✅ Executed: `specflow tasks F-4` - Created 11 implementation tasks in 5 phases

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`):

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | ✅ Each task marked [T] has associated test file |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | ✅ Implementation details and test cases specified |
| Dependencies are explicit | ✅ Dependency graph and per-task deps documented |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | ✅ 5 phases with explicit execution order |

  ✅ All 11 tasks have [T] marker indicating testable, test files specified, and dependency graph included

- [x] **Check task granularity**:
  - [x] No task is too large (can be done in one session) ✅ Each task is atomic (interface, function, or test)
  - [x] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped) ✅ Related functionality grouped (e.g., T-2.3 bundles utilities)
  - [x] Each task has a verifiable outcome ✅ Every task has test cases or validation criteria

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `③ tasks`

  ✅ Verified: F-4 (PII Scrubbing) now shows phase: `③ tasks`

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present task breakdown to human for review before implementation.

Show:
1. `tasks.md` breakdown
2. Task dependencies
3. Estimated scope

**Only proceed to Step 4 after human approval.**
