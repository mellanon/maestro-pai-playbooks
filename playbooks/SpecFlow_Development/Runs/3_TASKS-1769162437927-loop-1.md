# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists**: *COMPLETED 2026-01-23 by Signal-2: F-2 plan.md exists (16KB), spec.md exists (10KB)*
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase**: *COMPLETED 2026-01-23 by Signal-2: tasks.md created (9.6KB) with 8 implementation units (T-1.1 through T-4.2) organized into 4 phases*
  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`): *VALIDATED 2026-01-23 by Signal-2*

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | ✓ All 8 tasks reference log.test.ts |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | ✓ Each task has explicit deliverable checkboxes |
| Dependencies are explicit | ✓ Dependencies listed (e.g., T-2.1 → T-1.1) |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | ✓ Phase 1-4 execution order documented |

- [x] **Check task granularity**: *VALIDATED 2026-01-23 by Signal-2*
  - [x] No task is too large (can be done in one session) - *Each task is a focused function or test category*
  - [x] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped) - *Related helpers grouped (T-3.1), tests grouped (T-4.1)*
  - [x] Each task has a verifiable outcome - *Validation checklist with bun commands provided*

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**: *VERIFIED 2026-01-23 by Signal-2: spec.md frontmatter shows `status: "tasks"`*
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `③ tasks`

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present task breakdown to human for review before implementation.

Show:
1. `tasks.md` breakdown
2. Task dependencies
3. Estimated scope

**Only proceed to Step 4 after human approval.**
