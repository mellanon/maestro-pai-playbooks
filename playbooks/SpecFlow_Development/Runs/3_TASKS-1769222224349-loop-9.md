# Step 3: TASKS - Break Down Implementation

**Phase**: Task Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Break the feature into reviewable implementation units with dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Technical plan approved (plan.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "plan"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify plan exists** ✅ (Loop 9: specflow validate F-13 confirms spec.md 20KB + plan.md 19KB exist, phase: plan):
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `② plan`

### 2. Create Task Breakdown

- [x] **Run the tasks phase** ✅ (Loop 9: Created tasks.md with 14 tasks in 6 phases, 4 parallelizable):
  ```bash
  specflow tasks <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow tasks F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  ├── plan.md      ← (from step 2)
  └── tasks.md     ← Implementation units
  ```

### 3. Validate Task Quality

- [x] **Check tasks follow TDD pattern** (`docs/TDD-EVALS.md`) ✅ (Loop 9):

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Each task is independently testable | ✅ Each has "Test:" line with verification command |
| Tasks have clear acceptance criteria | ✅ All have "Validation:" sections with outcomes |
| Dependencies are explicit | ✅ Each lists dependencies (e.g., "Dependencies: T-1.1") |
| Tasks are ordered by dependency | ✅ Execution Order section shows dependency graph |

- [x] **Check task granularity** ✅ (Loop 9):
  - [x] No task is too large (can be done in one session) ✅ Each task is single function/feature
  - [x] No task is too small (trivial changes grouped) ✅ T-1.1 groups shebang+header+defaults+state
  - [x] Each task has a verifiable outcome ✅ All have test procedures and validation criteria

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status** ✅ (Loop 9: F-13 shows phase: ③ tasks):
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `③ tasks`

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- Feature phase updated to "tasks"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 4 (IMPLEMENT) to begin TDD implementation.
