# Step 2: PLAN - Create Technical Architecture

**Phase**: Planning | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Create a technical architecture plan including data models, failure modes, and design decisions.

## Prerequisites

- Specification approved (spec.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "specify"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify spec exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `① specify`

  ✅ Verified: F-15 (Docker Compose Stack) is in phase `① specify` and spec.md exists at `.specify/specs/f-15-docker-compose-stack/spec.md`

### 2. Create Technical Plan

- [x] **Run the plan phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow plan <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow plan F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  └── plan.md      ← Architecture decisions
  ```

  ✅ Ran `specflow plan F-15` - plan.md created at `.specify/specs/f-15-docker-compose-stack/plan.md` with comprehensive technical architecture including corrected VictoriaTraces port (10428 instead of spec's 9411).

### 3. Validate Plan Quality

- [x] **Check plan covers**:

| Section | Included? |
|---------|-----------|
| Data models | ✅ Volume Structure section with named volumes and internal paths |
| API/Interface design | ✅ API Contracts section with VictoriaMetrics, VictoriaLogs, VictoriaTraces endpoints |
| Error handling strategy | ✅ Health checks configured with 30s interval, 10s timeout, 3 retries |
| Failure modes | ✅ Risk Assessment table covers port conflicts, Docker not installed, disk space, image pull failures, memory exhaustion |
| Dependencies | ✅ Prerequisites section with Docker, Compose versions, port availability; External Services listing required images |
| Testing strategy | ✅ Validation steps in each Implementation Phase + Success Criteria Checklist |

- [x] **Check design against PAI principles**:

| Principle | Applied? |
|-----------|----------|
| Code before prompts | ✅ All configuration in YAML files (docker-compose.yml, datasources.yml), no prompt-driven setup |
| Deterministic where possible | ✅ Pinned image versions, explicit port mappings, declarative volume configuration |
| CLI-first interfaces | ✅ manage.sh script integration (stack-up, stack-down, stack-status, stack-logs, stack-reset) |

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `② plan`

  ✅ Verified: F-15 now shows phase `② plan` in specflow status output.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/plan.md` with technical architecture
- Feature phase updated to "plan"

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present plan to human for review before proceeding.

Show:
1. `plan.md` architecture decisions
2. Data models and interfaces
3. Failure modes and mitigations

**Only proceed to Step 3 after human approval.**
