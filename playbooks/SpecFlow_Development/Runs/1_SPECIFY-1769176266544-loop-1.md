# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  > **Completed**: SpecFlow is initialized with 15 features (5 complete, 10 pending)

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.
  > **Completed**: Already initialized, skipped

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles
  > **Completed**: Read `skills/CORE/SYSTEM/PAISYSTEMARCHITECTURE.md` - The 7 Founding Principles including determinism, CLI-first, UNIX philosophy

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  > **Completed**: F-15 (Docker Compose Stack) is highest priority pending feature at priority 1

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  > **Completed**: F-15 Docker Compose Stack selected (priority 1, no phase started)

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```
  > **Completed**: Created `.specify/specs/f-15-docker-compose-stack/spec.md` with full specification
  > Note: `specflow specify --batch` had a bug, so spec was created manually following F-5 template

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | PASS - Health checks, docker stats, port checks |
| Requirements are atomic | PASS - Each container is independent |
| No ambiguity | PASS - Exact YAML configurations provided |
| Dependencies identified | PASS - Docker/OrbStack upstream, F-11 downstream |

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | Yes | PASS - Docker Compose is reproducible |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | Yes | PASS - `docker compose` commands documented |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | Yes | PASS - Each container has single purpose |

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```
  > **Completed**: F-15 phase is now "specify"

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  > **Completed**: Verified via `specflow phase F-15 specify`

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present spec to human for review before proceeding.

Show:
1. `spec.md` requirements
2. Feature description and rationale

**Only proceed to Step 2 after human approval.**

## Agent Notes (Signal-1)

**Feature Specified:** F-15 Docker Compose Stack

**Spec Location:** `.specify/specs/f-15-docker-compose-stack/spec.md`

**Summary:** Created comprehensive specification for the PAI Signal observability stack Docker Compose configuration including:
- VictoriaMetrics (port 8428) - Time series metrics
- VictoriaLogs (port 9428) - Log aggregation
- VictoriaTraces (port 9411) - Distributed tracing
- Grafana (port 3000) - Visualization frontend

**Design Decisions:**
- VictoriaMetrics stack over Grafana LGTM (lower RAM, ~400MB vs ~1GB)
- Named volumes for data persistence
- Auto-provisioned Grafana datasources
- Security defaults (no signup, env-based password)

**Next Steps:** Human approval required before proceeding to PLAN phase.
