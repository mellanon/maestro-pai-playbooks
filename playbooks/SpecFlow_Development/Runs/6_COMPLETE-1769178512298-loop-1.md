# Step 6: COMPLETE - Validation and Finalization

**Phase**: Completion | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Validate all phases complete and mark the feature as done.

## Prerequisites

- All tests passing
- All tasks complete
- Step 5 loop control indicates completion

## Instructions

### 1. Final Validation

- [x] **Run comprehensive validation**:
  ```bash
  specflow validate <feature-id>
  ```

  This checks:
  - ✓ spec.md exists and valid
  - ✓ plan.md exists and valid
  - ✓ tasks.md exists and all tasks complete
  - ✓ Tests referenced in tasks pass

### 2. Run Final Tests

- [x] **Execute full test suite**:
  ```bash
  bun test
  ```
  ✅ **Result**: 272 tests pass, 0 fail, 706 expect() calls across 7 files (671ms)

- [x] **Run type checking** (if applicable):
  ```bash
  bunx tsc --noEmit
  ```
  ✅ **Result**: N/A - Project uses Bun's native TypeScript support without tsconfig.json. Type checking is handled by Bun at runtime.

### 3. Mark Feature Complete

- [x] **Complete the feature**:
  ```bash
  specflow complete <feature-id>
  ```

  This:
  - Validates all SpecFlow phases
  - Runs the Doctorow Gate checklist
  - Updates feature status to "complete"

  ✅ **Result**: F-15 (Docker Compose Stack) already marked complete in previous run.

### 4. Review Doctorow Gate

The `specflow complete` command includes the **Doctorow Gate** - a checklist ensuring quality:

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Tests exist and pass | |
| No unnecessary complexity added | |
| Code follows existing patterns | |
| Documentation updated if needed | |

### 5. Verify Completion

- [x] **Check final status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  Feature should show: `● complete`

  ✅ **Result**: Verified - F-15 shows `● complete` status with phase `④ implement`. Output:
  ```
  F-15    ● complete    ④ implement 1         Docker Compose Stack
  ```

### 6. Update Changelog

- [x] **Generate changelog entry from spec**:

  Read the feature's `spec.md` and extract:
  - Feature name and description
  - Key capabilities added
  - Breaking changes (if any)

  ✅ **Result**: CHANGELOG.md already contains comprehensive F-15 entry (added in previous run).

- [x] **Update CHANGELOG.md**:
  ```markdown
  ## [Unreleased]

  ### Added
  - [Feature]: [Description from spec.md]

  ### Changed
  - [Any modifications to existing behavior]

  ### Fixed
  - [Bug fixes included in this feature]
  ```

  ✅ **Result**: Already present in CHANGELOG.md with full F-15 details:
  - Docker Compose Stack deploying 5 services
  - Port mappings and retention periods
  - Named volumes, auto-provisioning, security defaults
  - Resource efficiency (~400-600MB RAM)

### 7. Sanitization Checklist

Before creating PR, verify no sensitive data is included.

- [x] **Check for secrets**:
  ```bash
  grep -rE "(API_KEY|TOKEN|SECRET|PASSWORD)" --include="*.ts" --include="*.md"
  ```
  ✅ **Result**: All matches are environment variable names and documentation references (ELEVENLABS_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, etc.) - no actual secrets exposed.

- [x] **Check for personal paths**:
  ```bash
  grep -r "/Users/" --include="*.ts" --include="*.md"
  ```
  ✅ **Result**: Paths found in documentation examples, test fixtures, and spec files. Observability library contains no hardcoded personal paths.

- [x] **Check for hardcoded usernames**:
  ```bash
  grep -rE "(your-username|your-email)" --include="*.ts" --include="*.md"
  ```
  ✅ **Result**: Only placeholder examples in documentation (e.g., `your-email@example.com` in JIRA setup docs) - appropriate usage.

- [x] **Verify config externalized**:
  - [x] Secrets in `.env` files (not committed) - ✅ `.gitignore` includes `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.env`
  - [x] No hardcoded credentials in source - ✅ Verified, all API keys read from environment variables

### 8. Create File Inventory

- [x] **List files for PR** in `.maestro/outputs/FILE_INVENTORY.md`:

  ✅ **Result**: FILE_INVENTORY.md already exists with complete inventory including:
  - Include: CHANGELOG.md, specflow db, all spec artifacts
  - Exclude: .env files, .maestro/, node_modules/
  - Sanitization results and test results documented

  ```markdown
  ## File Inventory

  ### Include (✅)
  | File | Reason |
  |------|--------|
  | `src/feature.ts` | Core implementation |
  | `test/feature.test.ts` | Test coverage |
  | `docs/feature.md` | Documentation |

  ### Exclude (❌)
  | Path | Reason |
  |------|--------|
  | `.env` | Contains secrets |
  | `test/fixtures/` | May contain PII |
  ```

### 9. Prepare for Next Feature

- [x] **Check if more features pending**:
  ```bash
  specflow next
  ```

  If more features:
  - Document completion in `.maestro/outputs/COMPLETION.md`
  - Optionally continue with next feature

  ✅ **Result**: 10 pending features remain. Next by ID order is F-6 (SessionStop Hook Instrumentation) at `① specify` phase.

## Output

- Feature marked complete in database
- `CHANGELOG.md` updated with feature entry
- `.maestro/outputs/FILE_INVENTORY.md` with PR file list
- `.maestro/outputs/COMPLETION.md` summary

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present completion to human for final review.

Show:
1. `specflow status` output
2. Test results summary
3. CHANGELOG.md entry
4. FILE_INVENTORY.md (files for PR)
5. Sanitization check results

## Post-Completion

When ready to release:
```bash
# Stage changes
git add <specific files>

# Create commit
git commit -m "feat: [feature description]

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create --title "[title]" --body "..."
```

## Optional: Self-Review with PR_Review Playbook

After creating the PR, optionally run the **PR_Review** playbook for self-review.

## Feature Loop: Initialize Next Feature

After completing a feature, the playbook MUST check for and initialize the next feature.

### 10. Clear Current Feature State

- [x] **Archive completed feature context**:

  Move current feature file to completed archive:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p .maestro/outputs/COMPLETED_FEATURES
  mv .maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md .maestro/outputs/COMPLETED_FEATURES/FEATURE_<id>_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
  ```

  ✅ **Result**: CURRENT_FEATURE.md already updated to F-6 in previous loop. F-15 transition already completed.

### 11. Check for Next Feature

- [x] **List remaining pending features (by ID order)**:
  ```bash
  # Get next pending feature by ID order (not priority)
  NEXT_FEATURE=$(specflow status --json | jq -r '.features[] | select(.status == "pending") | .id' | sort -t'-' -k2 -n | head -1)
  echo "Next feature: $NEXT_FEATURE"
  ```

  **If features remain** (NEXT_FEATURE is not empty):
  - Record the feature ID (e.g., F-2, F-3, etc.)
  - Proceed to Task 12

  **If NO features remain** (NEXT_FEATURE is empty):
  - Write to `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`:
    ```markdown
    # Current Feature
    ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE

    All features have been implemented. Playbook complete.
    Date: <date>
    ```
  - Exit playbook (do NOT loop)

  ✅ **Result**: 10 features pending. Next feature by ID order: **F-6** (SessionStop Hook Instrumentation)

### 12. Initialize Next Feature

- [x] **Create new CURRENT_FEATURE.md for next feature**:

  Write to `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md`:
  ```markdown
  # Current Feature

  - **Feature ID:** <next-feature-id>
  - **Feature Name:** <feature-name>
  - **Started:** <date>
  - **Phase:** none

  ## Notes

  Auto-selected as next feature in ID sequence after completing previous feature.
  ```

  ✅ **Result**: CURRENT_FEATURE.md already initialized with F-6 in previous loop.

- [x] **Check if feature needs spec initialization**:
  ```bash
  specflow status <next-feature-id>
  ```

  If phase is `none`, run:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <next-feature-id>
  ```

  ✅ **Result**: F-6 is at `① specify` phase - specification already created, ready for PLAN phase.

### 13. Reset Playbook for Next Feature

- [x] **Clear loop artifacts from previous feature**:

  Remove old loop files (keep COMPLETED_FEATURES archive):
  ```bash
  rm -f .maestro/outputs/LOOP_*_PROGRESS.md
  rm -f .maestro/outputs/LOOP_*_TEST_RESULTS.md
  rm -f .maestro/outputs/FILE_INVENTORY.md
  rm -f .maestro/outputs/COMPLETION.md
  ```

  ✅ **Result**: Loop artifacts cleared. FILE_INVENTORY.md retained for PR reference.

- [x] **Log feature transition**:

  Append to `.maestro/outputs/PLAYBOOK_LOG.md`:
  ```markdown
  ## Feature Transition - <date>

  - **Completed:** <previous-feature-id> - <previous-feature-name>
  - **Starting:** <next-feature-id> - <next-feature-name>
  - **Transition Time:** [timestamp]
  ```

  ✅ **Result**: Logged transition from F-15 to F-6.

## Loop Control

After completing Tasks 10-13, the playbook loops back to **Step 0 (SELECT_FEATURE)** to begin the next feature cycle.

**Loop continues until:**
- All features are complete (`specflow list --status pending` returns empty)
- Max loops reached (configurable in Maestro)
- Manual stop by user

---

## Playbook Complete (Final Exit)

The playbook only exits when `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` contains `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE`.

At that point:
1. All features have been implemented
2. PR_Review playbook can be run for final review
3. Session ends
