# Step 2: PLAN - Create Technical Architecture

**Phase**: Planning | **Gate**: Human Approval Required

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Create a technical architecture plan including data models, failure modes, and design decisions.

## Prerequisites

- Specification approved (spec.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "specify"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify spec exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `① specify`

  ✅ **Completed**: Found F-15 (Docker Compose Stack) in phase `① specify` with priority 1, and F-6 (SessionStop Hook) also in `① specify`. F-15 will be planned first due to higher priority.

### 2. Create Technical Plan

- [x] **Run the plan phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow plan <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow plan F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  └── plan.md      ← Architecture decisions
  ```

  ✅ **Completed**: Ran `specflow plan F-15`. Created plan.md with architecture diagrams, implementation phases, data models, API contracts, and risk assessment.

### 3. Validate Plan Quality

- [x] **Check plan covers**:

| Section | Included? |
|---------|-----------|
| Data models | ✅ Volume data persistence, retention configuration, network model |
| API/Interface design | ✅ API contracts for all 4 services (VictoriaMetrics, VictoriaLogs, VictoriaTraces, Grafana) |
| Error handling strategy | ✅ Rollback plan with step-by-step recovery commands |
| Failure modes | ✅ Risk assessment table with 6 risks, likelihood, impact, mitigation |
| Dependencies | ✅ Prerequisites table, image dependencies, Grafana plugin dependencies |
| Testing strategy | ✅ Phase 5 verification with health checks, UI validation, resource checks |

- [x] **Check design against PAI principles**:

| Principle | Applied? |
|-----------|----------|
| Code before prompts | ✅ Docker Compose YAML is declarative code, no prompts involved |
| Deterministic where possible | ✅ Named volumes ensure data persistence; explicit version tags recommended |
| CLI-first interfaces | ✅ All validation via CLI commands (docker compose, curl health checks) |

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `② plan`

  ✅ **Completed**: F-15 now shows phase: `② plan` (confirmed via specflow status)

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/plan.md` with technical architecture
- Feature phase updated to "plan"

## Human Gate

**STOP** - Present plan to human for review before proceeding.

Show:
1. `plan.md` architecture decisions
2. Data models and interfaces
3. Failure modes and mitigations

**Only proceed to Step 3 after human approval.**
