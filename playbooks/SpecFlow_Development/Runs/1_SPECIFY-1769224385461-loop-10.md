# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  ✅ **ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE** - SpecFlow initialized with 16 features (15 complete, 1 skipped)

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  N/A - Already initialized

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  N/A - Playbook complete, no new features to specify

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```
  16 features | 15 complete | 0 in progress | 0 pending | 1 skipped
  Progress: 94%
  ```

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)
  ✅ `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` shows **ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE** - no pending features

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  N/A - No pending features. All 16 features have been processed through the full SPECIFY → PLAN → TASKS → IMPLEMENT pipeline.

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:
  N/A - All features already validated and implemented

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:
  N/A - All features already validated and implemented

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ✅ All 16 features processed: 15 complete, 1 skipped (F-12 Vector Configuration)
  ✅ 394 tests passing

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**
  ✅ Playbook complete - ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE confirmed in Loop 9 and Loop 10

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database
