# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **Check if SpecFlow initialized**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  **✅ PLAYBOOK COMPLETE** - SpecFlow status shows:
  - 16 features total | 15 complete | 1 skipped (F-12)
  - Progress: 94%
  - 394 tests passing
  - `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` reports: `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE`

  No remaining features require specification. The playbook has completed all implementation work.

- [x] **If not initialized**, load from requirements spec:
  ```bash
  specflow init --from-spec docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
  ```

  Or describe the project:
  ```bash
  specflow init "Description of the application or project"
  ```

  This decomposes the requirements into features in the queue.

  **N/A** - Already initialized and complete.

- [x] **Read constitutional gates** for this phase:
  - `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design must follow founding principles

  **N/A** - Playbook complete, no new features to specify.

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **View feature queue**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```

  **N/A** - Status already checked above: 16 features total, 15 complete, 1 skipped.

- [x] **Identify the next feature** to work on (from `.maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md` or highest priority pending)

  **N/A** - No next feature; `ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE`.

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **Run the specify phase** for the target feature:
  ```bash
  specflow specify <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow specify F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  └── spec.md     ← Detailed requirements
  ```

  **N/A** - No features remaining to specify.

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **Check spec format** against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Requirements are testable | N/A |
| Requirements are atomic | N/A |
| No ambiguity | N/A |
| Dependencies identified | N/A |

**N/A** - No new specs to validate.

- [x] **Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`**:

| Principle | Applies? | Validated? |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Deterministic code preferred | N/A | N/A |
| CLI interfaces where applicable | N/A | N/A |
| UNIX philosophy (single purpose) | N/A | N/A |

**N/A** - No new designs to validate.

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status --json | jq '.features[] | select(.id=="<feature-id>")'
  ```

  **N/A** - All features already complete.

- [x] **Confirm phase is "specify"**

  **COMPLETE** - Playbook finished. ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE status confirmed.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database
