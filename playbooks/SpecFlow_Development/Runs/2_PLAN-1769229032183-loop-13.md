# Step 2: PLAN - Create Technical Architecture

**Phase**: Planning | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Objective

Create a technical architecture plan including data models, failure modes, and design decisions.

## Prerequisites

- Specification approved (spec.md exists and human approved)
- Feature phase is "specify"

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current Status

- [x] **Verify spec exists**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should show phase: `① specify`

  > **Loop 13 Result:** Ran `specflow status` - ALL 16 FEATURES ARE COMPLETE (100%). No features in `① specify` phase. Project has reached full completion. See `.maestro/outputs/COMPLETION.md` for the full completion report.

### 2. Create Technical Plan

- [x] **Run the plan phase**:
  ```bash
  specflow plan <feature-id>
  ```

  Example: `specflow plan F-001`

  This creates:
  ```
  .specify/<feature-id>/
  ├── spec.md      ← (from step 1)
  └── plan.md      ← Architecture decisions
  ```

  > **Loop 13 Result:** N/A - No features require planning. All 16 features already completed through all phases.

### 3. Validate Plan Quality

- [x] **Check plan covers**:

| Section | Included? |
|---------|-----------|
| Data models | N/A |
| API/Interface design | N/A |
| Error handling strategy | N/A |
| Failure modes | N/A |
| Dependencies | N/A |
| Testing strategy | N/A |

- [x] **Check design against PAI principles**:

| Principle | Applied? |
|-----------|----------|
| Code before prompts | N/A |
| Deterministic where possible | N/A |
| CLI-first interfaces | N/A |

> **Loop 13 Result:** Validation skipped - all 16 features are already complete. All plan.md files were created in previous loops.

### 4. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **Check feature status**:
  ```bash
  specflow status
  ```
  Feature should now show phase: `② plan`

  > **Loop 13 Result:** All 16 features at phase `④ implement` (COMPLETE). No features pending planning. Project is 100% done.

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/plan.md` with technical architecture
- Feature phase updated to "plan"

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 3 (TASKS) to break down implementation units.
