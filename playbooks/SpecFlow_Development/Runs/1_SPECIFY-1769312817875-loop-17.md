# Step 1: SPECIFY - Create Feature Specification

**Phase**: Specification | **Gate**: Automated

---

## Context
- **Playbook:** SpecFlow Development
- **State Directory:** `.maestro/` (in project root)

## Input Specification

**Read and analyze the requirements specification** (if available in assets):
```bash
ls assets/*.md 2>/dev/null  # Check for bundled spec
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null    # Check for project docs
```

## Objective

Create a detailed specification for the feature through interview-driven requirements gathering.

## Phase Guard (MUST RUN FIRST)

Before doing any work, verify this step should run:

- [x] **Check if this step should execute**:
  ```bash
  # Read current feature ID
  FEATURE_ID=$(grep "Feature ID:" .maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md 2>/dev/null | awk -F: '{print $2}' | tr -d ' ')

  # Check if ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE
  if grep -q "ALL_FEATURES_COMPLETE" .maestro/CURRENT_FEATURE.md 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "PHASE_GUARD: SKIP - All features complete"
    exit 0
  fi

  # Check feature exists
  if [[ -z "$FEATURE_ID" ]]; then
    echo "PHASE_GUARD: SKIP - No current feature"
    exit 0
  fi

  # Step 1 only runs when phase is "none" or "specify"
  PHASE=$(specflow status "$FEATURE_ID" --json 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.phase' 2>/dev/null || echo "none")

  if [[ "$PHASE" != "none" && "$PHASE" != "specify" ]]; then
    echo "PHASE_GUARD: SKIP - Feature already past specify phase (current: $PHASE)"
    exit 0
  fi

  echo "PHASE_GUARD: PROCEED - $FEATURE_ID needs specification (phase: $PHASE)"
  ```

**Phase Guard Result:** `PHASE_GUARD: SKIP - All features complete`

All 18 features have been successfully implemented. The playbook is complete.

**If phase guard returns SKIP:** Mark ALL remaining tasks below as `[x] SKIPPED - Phase guard` and proceed to next document. This prevents stall detection from flagging unchecked boxes.

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project (if needed)

- [x] **SKIPPED - Phase guard** - Check if SpecFlow initialized

- [x] **SKIPPED - Phase guard** - If not initialized, load from requirements spec

- [x] **SKIPPED - Phase guard** - Read constitutional gates for this phase

### 2. Check Current Status

- [x] **SKIPPED - Phase guard** - View feature queue

- [x] **SKIPPED - Phase guard** - Identify the next feature to work on

### 3. Create Specification

- [x] **SKIPPED - Phase guard** - Run the specify phase for the target feature

### 4. Validate Spec Quality

- [x] **SKIPPED - Phase guard** - Check spec format against `docs/TDD-EVALS.md`

- [x] **SKIPPED - Phase guard** - Check design against `docs/PAI-PRINCIPLES.md`

### 5. Verify Phase Complete

- [x] **SKIPPED - Phase guard** - Check feature status

- [x] **SKIPPED - Phase guard** - Confirm phase is "specify"

## Output

- `.specify/<feature-id>/spec.md` with detailed requirements
- Feature status updated in database

## Next

→ Proceed to Step 2 (PLAN) to create technical architecture.
